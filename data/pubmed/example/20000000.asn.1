    abstract "The effects of municipal sewage irrigation on the soil and black
 locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) tree were studied. For this purpose, two
 artificial black locust stands under irrigation of municipal sewage and well
 water were selected in south of Tehran, Iran. Data were collected using
 technique of systematic random sampling with 4 replicates in each stand. It
 was found that the growth of black locust tree, as indicated by diameter at
 breast height, total height, crown length, average crown diameter, basal area
 and volume, in sewage irrigation stand was much higher than that of well
 water irrigation stand (P < 0.01). Plant analysis indicated that
 concentrations of leaf nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn)
 were greater in sewage-irrigated trees, without toxicity to the minerals of
 tree leaf, than those of well waterirrigated trees, and positively correlated
 with their respective value in soil. Ni, Cr and Pb were not detected in leaf
 samples. Application of sewage resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the
 concentrations of soil nutrients, Ni, Cr and Pb. Among these minerals only Pb
 and Ni in some soil samples exceeded the toxicity limit. The increase in pH,
 electrical conductivity (EC) and organic carbon of soil was also observed in
 sewage irrigation. Results confirm that besides the use as irrigation water,
 municipal sewages are also a potential source of plant nutrients. However,
 significant accumulation of heavy metals such as Pb and Ni in soil needs to
 be monitored.",

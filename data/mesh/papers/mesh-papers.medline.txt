      MeSH terms.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0173548 [doi]
AB  - Identifying drug-drug interaction (DDI) is an important topic for the development
      of safe pharmaceutical drugs and for the optimization of multidrug regimens for
      complex diseases such as cancer and HIV. There have been about 150,000
      publications on DDIs in PubMed, which is a great resource for DDI studies. In
      this paper, we introduced an automatic computational method for the systematic
      analysis of the mechanism of DDIs using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms
      from PubMed literature. MeSH term is a controlled vocabulary thesaurus developed 
      by the National Library of Medicine for indexing and annotating articles. Our
      method can effectively identify DDI-relevant MeSH terms such as drugs, proteins
      and phenomena with high accuracy. The connections among these MeSH terms were
      investigated by using co-occurrence heatmaps and social network analysis. Our
      approach can be used to visualize relationships of DDI terms, which has the
      potential to help users better understand DDIs. As the volume of PubMed records
      increases, our method for automatic analysis of DDIs from the PubMed database
      will become more accurate.

TI  - MeSH Now: automatic MeSH indexing at PubMed scale via learning to rank.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s13326-017-0123-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MeSH indexing is the task of assigning relevant MeSH terms based on a
      manual reading of scholarly publications by human indexers. The task is highly
      important for improving literature retrieval and many other scientific
      investigations in biomedical research. Unfortunately, given its manual nature,
      the process of MeSH indexing is both time-consuming (new articles are not
      immediately indexed until 2 or 3 months later) and costly (approximately ten
      dollars per article). In response, automatic indexing by computers has been
      previously proposed and attempted but remains challenging. In order to advance
      the state of the art in automatic MeSH indexing, a community-wide shared task
      called BioASQ was recently organized. METHODS: We propose MeSH Now, an integrated
      approach that first uses multiple strategies to generate a combined list of
      candidate MeSH terms for a target article. Through a novel learning-to-rank
      framework, MeSH Now then ranks the list of candidate terms based on their
      relevance to the target article. Finally, MeSH Now selects the highest-ranked
      MeSH terms via a post-processing module. RESULTS: We assessed MeSH Now on two
      separate benchmarking datasets using traditional precision, recall and F1-score
      metrics. In both evaluations, MeSH Now consistently achieved over 0.60 in
      F-score, ranging from 0.610 to 0.612. Furthermore, additional experiments show
      that MeSH Now can be optimized by parallel computing in order to process MEDLINE 
      documents on a large scale. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MeSH Now is a robust
      approach with state-of-the-art performance for automatic MeSH indexing and that
      MeSH Now is capable of processing PubMed scale documents within a reasonable time
      frame. AVAILABILITY: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/MeSHNow/ .

TI  - A MeSH-based text mining method for identifying novel prebiotics.
PG  - e5585
AB  - Prebiotics contribute to the well-being of their host by altering the composition
      of the gut microbiota. Discovering new prebiotics is a challenging and arduous
      task due to strict inclusion criteria; thus, highly limited numbers of prebiotic 
      candidates have been identified. Notably, the large numbers of published studies 
      may contain substantial information attached to various features of known
      prebiotics that can be used to predict new candidates. In this paper, we propose 
      a medical subject headings (MeSH)-based text mining method for identifying new
      prebiotics with structured texts obtained from PubMed. We defined an optimal
      feature set for prebiotics prediction using a systematic feature-ranking
      algorithm with which a variety of carbohydrates can be accurately classified into
      different clusters in accordance with their chemical and biological attributes.
      The optimal feature set was used to separate positive prebiotics from other
      carbohydrates, and a cross-validation procedure was employed to assess the
      prediction accuracy of the model. Our method achieved a specificity of 0.876 and 
      a sensitivity of 0.838. Finally, we identified a high-confidence list of
      candidates of prebiotics that are strongly supported by the literature. Our study
      demonstrates that text mining from high-volume biomedical literature is a
      promising approach in searching for new prebiotics.

TI  - COEXPEDIA: exploring biomedical hypotheses via co-expressions associated with
      medical subject headings (MeSH).
PG  - D389-D396
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw868 [doi]
AB  - The use of high-throughput array and sequencing technologies has produced
      unprecedented amounts of gene expression data in central public depositories,
      including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The immense amount of expression
      data in GEO provides both vast research opportunities and data analysis
      challenges. Co-expression analysis of high-dimensional expression data has proven
      effective for the study of gene functions, and several co-expression databases
      have been developed. Here, we present a new co-expression database, COEXPEDIA
      (www.coexpedia.org), which is distinctive from other co-expression databases in
      three aspects: (i) it contains only co-functional co-expressions that passed a
      rigorous statistical assessment for functional association, (ii) the
      co-expressions were inferred from individual studies, each of which was designed 
      to investigate gene functions with respect to a particular biomedical context
      such as a disease and (iii) the co-expressions are associated with medical
      subject headings (MeSH) that provide biomedical information for anatomical,
      disease, and chemical relevance. COEXPEDIA currently contains approximately eight
      million co-expressions inferred from 384 and 248 GEO series for humans and mice, 
      respectively. We describe how these MeSH-associated co-expressions enable the
      identification of diseases and drugs previously unknown to be related to a gene
      or a gene group of interest.

PG  - 582-6
AB  - Big data resources are difficult to process without a scaled hardware environment
      that is specifically adapted to the problem. The emergence of flexible
      cloud-based virtualization techniques promises solutions to this problem. This
      paper demonstrates how a billion of lines can be processed in a reasonable amount
      of time in a cloud-based environment. Our use case addresses the accumulation of 
      concept co-occurrence data in MEDLINE annotation as a series of MapReduce jobs,
      which can be scaled and executed in the cloud. Besides showing an efficient way
      solving this problem, we generated an additional resource for the scientific
      community to be used for advanced text mining approaches.

TI  - Link Prediction on a Network of Co-occurring MeSH Terms: Towards Literature-based
      Discovery.
PG  - 340-6
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Literature-based discovery (LBD) is a text mining methodology for
      automatically generating research hypotheses from existing knowledge. We mimic
      the process of LBD as a classification problem on a graph of MeSH terms. We
      employ unsupervised and supervised link prediction methods for predicting
      previously unknown connections between biomedical concepts. METHODS: We evaluate 
      the effectiveness of link prediction through a series of experiments using a MeSH
      network that contains the history of link formation between biomedical concepts. 
      We performed link prediction using proximity measures, such as common neighbor
      (CN), Jaccard coefficient (JC), Adamic / Adar index (AA) and preferential
      attachment (PA). Our approach relies on the assumption that similar nodes are
      more likely to establish a link in the future. RESULTS: Applying an unsupervised 
      approach, the AA measure achieved the best performance in terms of area under the
      ROC curve (AUC = 0.76), followed by CN, JC, and PA. In a supervised approach, we 
      evaluate whether proximity measures can be combined to define a model of link
      formation across all four predictors. We applied various classifiers, including
      decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, 
      naive Bayes, and random forests. Random forest classifier accomplishes the best
      performance (AUC = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The link prediction approach proved to be 
      effective for LBD processing. Supervised statistical learning approaches clearly 
      outperform an unsupervised approach to link prediction.

TI  - Generalized enrichment analysis improves the detection of adverse drug events
      from the biomedical literature.
PG  - 250
LID - 10.1186/s12859-016-1080-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of associations between marketed drugs and adverse
      events from the biomedical literature assists drug safety monitoring efforts.
      Assessing the significance of such literature-derived associations and
      determining the granularity at which they should be captured remains a challenge.
      Here, we assess how defining a selection of adverse event terms from MeSH, based 
      on information content, can improve the detection of adverse events for drugs and
      drug classes. RESULTS: We analyze a set of 105,354 candidate drug adverse event
      pairs extracted from article indexes in MEDLINE. First, we harmonize extracted
      adverse event terms by aggregating them into higher-level MeSH terms based on the
      terms' information content. Then, we determine statistical enrichment of adverse 
      events associated with drug and drug classes using a conditional hypergeometric
      test that adjusts for dependencies among associated terms. We compare our results
      with methods based on disproportionality analysis (proportional reporting ratio, 
      PRR) and quantify the improvement in signal detection with our generalized
      enrichment analysis (GEA) approach using a gold standard of drug-adverse event
      associations spanning 174 drugs and four events. For single drugs, the best GEA
      method (Precision: .92/Recall: .71/F1-measure: .80) outperforms the best PRR
      based method (.69/.69/.69) on all four adverse event outcomes in our gold
      standard. For drug classes, our GEA performs similarly (.85/.69/.74) when
      increasing the level of abstraction for adverse event terms. Finally, on
      examining the 1609 individual drugs in our MEDLINE set, which map to chemical
      substances in ATC, we find signals for 1379 drugs (10,122 unique adverse event
      associations) on applying GEA with p < 0.005. CONCLUSIONS: We present an approach
      based on generalized enrichment analysis that can be used to detect associations 
      between drugs, drug classes and adverse events at a given level of granularity,
      at the same time correcting for known dependencies among events. Our study
      demonstrates the use of GEA, and the importance of choosing appropriate
      abstraction levels to complement current drug safety methods. We provide an R
      package for exploration of alternative abstraction levels of adverse event terms 
      based on information content.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Google Scholar is often used to search for medical literature. Numbers
      of results reported by Google Scholar outperform the numbers reported by
      traditional databases. How reliable are these numbers? Why are often not all
      available 1,000 references shown? METHODS: For several complex search strategies 
      used in systematic review projects, the number of citations and the total number 
      of versions were calculated. Several search strategies were followed over a
      two-year period, registering fluctuations in reported search results. RESULTS:
      Changes in numbers of reported search results varied enormously between search
      strategies and dates. Theories for calculations of the reported and shown number 
      of hits were not proved. CONCLUSIONS: The number of hits reported in Google
      Scholar is an unreliable measure. Therefore, its repeatability is problematic, at
      least when equal results are needed.

PG  - 109-17
LID - 10.3163/1536-5050.104.2.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative
      effectiveness of three web-scale discovery (WSD) tools in answering health
      sciences search queries. METHODS: Simple keyword searches, based on topics from
      six health sciences disciplines, were run at multiple real-world implementations 
      of EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), Ex Libris's Primo, and ProQuest's Summon. Each 
      WSD tool was evaluated in its ability to retrieve relevant results and in its
      coverage of MEDLINE content. RESULTS: All WSD tools returned between 50%-60%
      relevant results. Primo returned a higher number of duplicate results than the
      other 2 WSD products. Summon results were more relevant when search terms were
      automatically mapped to controlled vocabulary. EDS indexed the largest number of 
      MEDLINE citations, followed closely by Summon. Additionally, keyword searches in 
      all 3 WSD tools retrieved relevant material that was not found with precision
      (Medical Subject Headings) searches in MEDLINE. CONCLUSIONS: None of the 3 WSD
      products studied was overwhelmingly more effective in returning relevant results.
      While difficult to place the figure of 50%-60% relevance in context, it implies a
      strong likelihood that the average user would be able to find satisfactory
      sources on the first page of search results using a rudimentary keyword search.
      The discovery of additional relevant material beyond that retrieved from MEDLINE 
      indicates WSD tools' value as a supplement to traditional resources for health
      sciences researchers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to describe the volume and attributes 
      of original research available in PubMed on emerging knowledge synthesis methods 
      (excluding traditional systematic reviews) published by researchers. STUDY DESIGN
      AND SETTING: Bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: Six-hundred eight studies related to
      the topic of knowledge synthesis methods were analyzed. Although there has been a
      steady increase in publications on knowledge synthesis methods since 2003,
      studies are dispersed among a large number of journals. Similarly, a large number
      of authors are publishing on these methods but in limited numbers for any
      individual. Relevant Medical Subject Headings that were applied most often to
      these studies included qualitative research, research design, meta-analysis as
      topic, and review literature as topic. CONCLUSION: There is no prevailing journal
      or author that is a leader in reporting on knowledge synthesis methods. Relevant 
      Medical Subject Headings were either not applied to most records or not available
      for the synthesis method being examined. This may lend itself to inconsistencies 
      and variations in methods making it challenging for researchers and research
      users to locate and appraise these articles.

TI  - Use of scientific social networking to improve the research strategies of PubMed 
      readers.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s13104-016-1920-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Keeping up with journal articles on a daily basis is an important
      activity of scientists engaged in biomedical research. Usually, journal articles 
      and papers in the field of biomedicine are accessed through the Medline/PubMed
      electronic library. In the process of navigating PubMed, researchers unknowingly 
      generate user-specific reading profiles that can be shared within a social
      networking environment. This paper examines the structure of the social
      networking environment generated by PubMed users. METHODS: A web browser plugin
      was developed to map [in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms] the reading
      patterns of individual PubMed users. RESULTS: We developed a scientific social
      network based on the personal research profiles of readers of biomedical
      articles. A browser plugin is used to record the digital object identifier or
      PubMed ID of web pages. Recorded items are posted on the activity feed and
      automatically mapped to PubMed abstract. Within the activity feed a user can
      trace back previously browsed articles and insert comments. By calculating the
      frequency with which specific MeSH occur, the research interests of PubMed users 
      can be visually represented with a tag cloud. Finally, research profiles can be
      searched for matches between network users. CONCLUSIONS: A social networking
      environment was created using MeSH terms to map articles accessed through the
      Medline/PubMed online library system. In-network social communication is
      supported by the recommendation of articles and by matching users with similar
      scientific interests. The system is available at http://bioknol.org/en/.

AB  - ETHNO-PHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Natural products have long been the most
      important source of ingredients in the discovery of new drugs. Moreover, since
      the Nagoya Protocol, finding alternative herbs with similar efficacy in
      traditional medicine has become a very important issue. Although random selection
      is a common method of finding ethno-medicinal herbs of similar efficacy, it
      proved to be less effective; therefore, this paper proposes a novel targeted
      selection method using data mining approaches in the MEDLINE database in order to
      identify and select herbs with a similar degree of efficacy. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: From among sixteen categories of medical subject headings (MeSH)
      descriptors, three categories containing terms related to herbal compounds,
      efficacy, toxicity, and the metabolic process were selected. In order to select
      herbs of similar efficacy in a targeted way, we adopted the similarity
      measurement method based on MeSH. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, we
      built up three different validation datasets which contain lists of original
      herbs and corresponding medicinal herbs of similar efficacy. RESULTS: The average
      area under curve (AUC) of the proposed algorithm was found to be about 500%
      larger than the random selection method. We found that the proposed algorithm
      puts more hits at the front of the top-10 list than the random selection method, 
      and precisely discerns the efficacy of the herbs. It was also found that the AUC 
      of the experiments either remained the same or increased slightly in all three
      validation datasets as the search range was increased. CONCLUSION: This study
      reveals and proves that the proposed algorithm is significantly more accurate and
      efficient in finding alternative herbs of similar efficacy than the random
      selection method. As such, it is hoped that this approach will be used in diverse
      applications in the ethno-pharmacology field.

TI  - Search Strategy to Identify Dental Survival Analysis Articles Indexed in MEDLINE.
PG  - 20-7
LID - 10.11607/ijp.4304 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Articles reporting survival outcomes (time-to-event outcomes) in
      patients over time are challenging to identify in the literature. Research shows 
      the words authors use to describe their dental survival analyses vary, and that
      allocation of medical subject headings by MEDLINE indexers is inconsistent.
      Together, this undermines accurate article identification. The present study aims
      to develop and validate a search strategy to identify dental survival analyses
      indexed in MEDLINE (Ovid). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A gold standard cohort of
      articles was identified to derive the search terms, and an independent gold
      standard cohort of articles was identified to test and validate the proposed
      search strategies. The first cohort included all 6,955 articles published in the 
      50 dental journals with the highest impact factors in 2008, of which 95 articles 
      were dental survival articles. The second cohort included all 6,514 articles
      published in the 50 dental journals with the highest impact factors for 2012, of 
      which 148 were dental survival articles. Each cohort was identified by a
      systematic hand search. Performance parameters of sensitivity, precision, and
      number needed to read (NNR) for the search strategies were calculated. RESULTS:
      Sensitive, precise, and optimized search strategies were developed and validated.
      The performances of the search strategy maximizing sensitivity were 92%
      sensitivity, 14% precision, and 7.11 NNR; the performances of the strategy
      maximizing precision were 93% precision, 10% sensitivity, and 1.07 NNR; and the
      performances of the strategy optimizing the balance between sensitivity and
      precision were 83% sensitivity, 24% precision, and 4.13 NNR. The methods used to 
      identify search terms were objective, not subjective. The search strategies were 
      validated in an independent group of articles that included different journals
      and different publication years. CONCLUSIONS: Across the three search strategies,
      dental survival articles can be identified with sensitivity up to 92%, precision 
      up to 93%, and NNR of less than two articles to identify relevant records. This
      research has highlighted the impact that variation in reporting and indexing has 
      on article identification and has improved researchers' ability to identify
      dental survival articles.

AB  - The exploitation of heterogeneous clinical sources and healthcare records is
      fundamental in clinical and translational research. The determination of semantic
      similarity between word pairs is an important component of text understanding
      that enables the processing and structuring of textual resources. Some of these
      measures have been adapted to the biomedical field by incorporating domain
      information extracted from clinical data or from medical ontologies such as MeSH.
      This study focuses on Information Content (IC) based measures that exploit the
      topological parameters of the taxonomy to express the semantics of a concept. A
      new intrinsic IC computing method based on the taxonomical parameters of the
      ancestors' subgraph is then assigned to a biomedical concept into the "is a"
      hierarchy. Moreover, we present a study of the topological parameters through the
      MeSH taxonomy. This study treats the semantic interpretation and the different
      ways of expressing the parameters of depth and the descendants' subgraph. Using
      MeSH as an input ontology, the accuracy of our proposal is evaluated and compared
      against other IC-based measures according to several widely-used benchmarks of
      biomedical terms. The correlation between the results obtained for the evaluated 
      measure using the proposed approach and those from the ratings of human' experts 
      shows that our proposal outperforms the previous measures.

PG  - 17658
LID - 10.1038/srep17658 [doi]
AB  - We introduce a MeSH-based method that accurately quantifies similarity between
      heritable diseases at molecular level. This method effectively brings together
      the existing information about diseases that is scattered across the vast corpus 
      of biomedical literature. We prove that sets of MeSH terms provide a highly
      descriptive representation of heritable disease and that the structure of MeSH
      provides a natural way of combining individual MeSH vocabularies. We show that
      our measure can be used effectively in the prediction of candidate disease genes.
      We developed a web application to query more than 28.5 million relationships
      between 7,574 hereditary diseases (96% of OMIM) based on our similarity measure.

TI  - Development of a PubMed Based Search Tool for Identifying Sex and Gender Specific
      Health Literature.
PG  - 181-7
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2015.5217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An effective literature search strategy is critical to achieving the 
      aims of Sex and Gender Specific Health (SGSH): to understand sex and gender
      differences through research and to effectively incorporate the new knowledge
      into the clinical decision making process to benefit both male and female
      patients. The goal of this project was to develop and validate an SGSH literature
      search tool that is readily and freely available to clinical researchers and
      practitioners. METHODS: PubMed, a freely available search engine for the Medline 
      database, was selected as the platform to build the SGSH literature search tool. 
      Combinations of Medical Subject Heading terms, text words, and title words were
      evaluated for optimal specificity and sensitivity. The search tool was then
      validated against reference bases compiled for two disease states, diabetes and
      stroke. RESULTS: Key sex and gender terms and limits were bundled to create a
      search tool to facilitate PubMed SGSH literature searches. During validation, the
      search tool retrieved 50 of 94 (53.2%) stroke and 62 of 95 (65.3%) diabetes
      reference articles selected for validation. A general keyword search of stroke or
      diabetes combined with sex difference retrieved 33 of 94 (35.1%) stroke and 22 of
      95 (23.2%) diabetes reference base articles, with lower sensitivity and
      specificity for SGSH content. CONCLUSIONS: The Texas Tech University Health
      Sciences Center SGSH PubMed Search Tool provides higher sensitivity and
      specificity to sex and gender specific health literature. The tool will
      facilitate research, clinical decision-making, and guideline development relevant
      to SGSH.

TI  - MeSHSim: An R/Bioconductor package for measuring semantic similarity over MeSH
      headings and MEDLINE documents.
PG  - 1542002
LID - 10.1142/S0219720015420020 [doi]
AB  - Currently, all MEDLINE documents are indexed by medical subject headings (MeSH). 
      Computing semantic similarity between two MeSH headings as well as two documents 
      has become very important for many biomedical text mining applications. We
      develop an R package, MeSHSim, which can compute nine similarity measures between
      MeSH nodes, by which similarity between MeSH headings as well as MEDLINE
      documents can be easily computed. Also, MeSHSim supports querying hierarchy
      information of a MeSH heading and retrieving MeSH headings of a query document,
      and can be easily integrated into pipelines for any biomedical text analysis
      tasks. MeSHSim is released under general public license (GPL), and available
      through Bioconductor and from Github at https://github.com/JingZhou2015/MeSHSim.

TI  - Lost in translation: Review of identification bias, translation bias and research
      waste in dentistry.
PG  - 26-33
LID - 10.1016/j.dental.2015.09.002 [doi]
LID - S0109-5641(15)00398-X [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review how articles are retrieved from bibliographic databases,
      what article identification and translation problems have affected research, and 
      how these problems can contribute to research waste and affect clinical practice.
      METHODS: This literature review sought and appraised articles regarding
      identification- and translation-bias in the medical and dental literature, which 
      limit the ability of users to find research articles and to use these in
      practice. RESULTS: Articles can be retrieved from bibliographic databases by
      performing a word or index-term (for example, MeSH for MEDLINE) search.
      Identification of articles is challenging when it is not clear which words are
      most relevant, and which terms have been allocated to indexing fields. Poor
      reporting quality of abstracts and articles has been reported across the medical 
      literature at large. Specifically in dentistry, research regarding time-to-event 
      survival analyses found the allocation of MeSH terms to be inconsistent and
      inaccurate, important words were omitted from abstracts by authors, and the
      quality of reporting in the body of articles was generally poor. These
      shortcomings mean that articles will be difficult to identify, and difficult to
      understand if found. Use of specialized electronic search strategies can decrease
      identification bias, and use of tailored reporting guidelines can decrease
      translation bias. Research that cannot be found, or cannot be used results in
      research waste, and undermines clinical practice. SIGNIFICANCE: Identification-
      and translation-bias have been shown to affect time-to-event dental articles, are
      likely affect other fields of research, and are largely unrecognized by authors
      and evidence seekers alike. By understanding that the problems exist, solutions
      can be sought to improve identification and translation of our research.

TI  - Acquiring Plausible Predications from MEDLINE by Clustering MeSH Annotations.
PG  - 716-20
AB  - The massive accumulation of biomedical knowledge is reflected by the growth of
      the literature database MEDLINE with over 23 million bibliographic records. All
      records are manually indexed by MeSH descriptors, many of them refined by MeSH
      subheadings. We use subheading information to cluster types of MeSH descriptor
      co-occurrences in MEDLINE by processing co-occurrence information provided by the
      UMLS. The goal is to infer plausible predicates to each resulting cluster. In an 
      initial experiment this was done by grouping disease-pharmacologic substance
      co-occurrences into six clusters. Then, a domain expert manually performed the
      assignment of meaningful predicates to the clusters. The mean accuracy of the
      best ten generated biomedical facts of each cluster was 85%. This result supports
      the evidence of the potential of MeSH subheadings for extracting plausible
      medical predications from MEDLINE.

TI  - Indexing Publicly Available Health Data with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): An 
      Evaluation of Term Coverage.
PG  - 529-33
AB  - As part of the Open Government Initiative, the United States federal government
      published datasets to increase collaboration, transparency, consumer
      participation, and research, and are available online at HealthData.gov.
      Currently, HealthData.gov does not adequately support the accessibility goal of
      the Open Government Initiative due to issues of retrieving relevant data because 
      of inadequately cataloguing and lack of indexing with a standardized terminology.
      Given the commonalities between the HealthData.gov and MEDLINE metadata, Medical 
      Subject Headings (MeSH) may offer an indexing solution, but there needs to be a
      formal evaluation of the efficacy of MeSH for covering the dataset concepts. The 
      purpose of this study was to determine if MeSH adequately covers the
      HealthData.gov concepts. The noun and noun phrases from the HealthData.gov
      metadata were extracted and mapped to MeSH using MetaMap. The frequency of no
      exact, partical and no matches with MeSH terms were determined. The results of
      this study revealed that about 70% of the HealthData.gov concepts partially or
      exactly matched MeSH terms. Therefore, MeSH may be a favorable terminology for
      indexing the HealthData.gov datasets.

TI  - Efficiency of pragmatic search strategies to update clinical guidelines
      recommendations.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s12874-015-0058-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major challenge in updating clinical guidelines is to efficiently
      identify new, relevant evidence. We evaluated the efficiency and feasibility of
      two new approaches: the development of restrictive search strategies using PubMed
      Clinical Queries for MEDLINE and the use of the PLUS (McMaster Premium Literature
      Service) database. METHODS: We evaluated a random sample of recommendations from 
      a national guideline development program and identified the references that would
      potentially trigger an update (key references) using an exhaustive approach. We
      designed restrictive search strategies using the minimum number of Medical
      Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and text words required from the original
      exhaustive search strategies and applying broad and narrow filters. We developed 
      PLUS search strategies, matching Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Systematized
      Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) terms with guideline topics. We compared the
      number of key references retrieved by these approaches with those retrieved by
      the exhaustive approach. RESULTS: The restrictive approach retrieved 68.1 % fewer
      references than the exhaustive approach (12,486 versus 39,136), and identified
      89.9 % (62/69) of key references and 88 % (22/25) of recommendation updates. The 
      use of PLUS retrieved 88.5 % fewer references than the exhaustive approach (4,486
      versus 39,136) and identified substantially fewer key references (18/69, 26.1 %) 
      and fewer recommendation updates (10/25, 40 %). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed
      restrictive approach is a highly efficient and feasible method to identify new
      evidence that triggers a recommendation update. Searching only in the PLUS
      database proved to be a suboptimal approach and suggests the need for
      topic-specific tailoring.

TI  - MeSHLabeler: improving the accuracy of large-scale MeSH indexing by integrating
      diverse evidence.
PG  - i339-47
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv237 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Medical Subject Headings (MeSHs) are used by National Library of
      Medicine (NLM) to index almost all citations in MEDLINE, which greatly
      facilitates the applications of biomedical information retrieval and text mining.
      To reduce the time and financial cost of manual annotation, NLM has developed a
      software package, Medical Text Indexer (MTI), for assisting MeSH annotation,
      which uses k-nearest neighbors (KNN), pattern matching and indexing rules. Other 
      types of information, such as prediction by MeSH classifiers (trained
      separately), can also be used for automatic MeSH annotation. However, existing
      methods cannot effectively integrate multiple evidence for MeSH annotation.
      METHODS: We propose a novel framework, MeSHLabeler, to integrate multiple
      evidence for accurate MeSH annotation by using 'learning to rank'. Evidence
      includes numerous predictions from MeSH classifiers, KNN, pattern matching, MTI
      and the correlation between different MeSH terms, etc. Each MeSH classifier is
      trained independently, and thus prediction scores from different classifiers are 
      incomparable. To address this issue, we have developed an effective score
      normalization procedure to improve the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: MeSHLabeler 
      won the first place in Task 2A of 2014 BioASQ challenge, achieving the Micro
      F-measure of 0.6248 for 9,040 citations provided by the BioASQ challenge. Note
      that this accuracy is around 9.15% higher than 0.5724, obtained by MTI.
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is available upon request.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in the next generation sequencing technology has accelerated
      the pace of individualized medicine (IM), which aims to incorporate
      genetic/genomic information into medicine. One immediate need in interpreting
      sequencing data is the assembly of information about genetic variants and their
      corresponding associations with other entities (e.g., diseases or medications).
      Even with dedicated effort to capture such information in biological databases,
      much of this information remains 'locked' in the unstructured text of biomedical 
      publications. There is a substantial lag between the publication and the
      subsequent abstraction of such information into databases. Multiple text mining
      systems have been developed, but most of them focus on the sentence level
      association extraction with performance evaluation based on gold standard text
      annotations specifically prepared for text mining systems. RESULTS: We developed 
      and evaluated a text mining system, MutD, which extracts protein mutation-disease
      associations from MEDLINE abstracts by incorporating discourse level analysis,
      using a benchmark data set extracted from curated database records. MutD achieves
      an F-measure of 64.3% for reconstructing protein mutation disease associations in
      curated database records. Discourse level analysis component of MutD contributed 
      to a gain of more than 10% in F-measure when compared against the sentence level 
      association extraction. Our error analysis indicates that 23 of the 64 precision 
      errors are true associations that were not captured by database curators and 68
      of the 113 recall errors are caused by the absence of associated disease entities
      in the abstract. After adjusting for the defects in the curated database, the
      revised F-measure of MutD in association detection reaches 81.5%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our quantitative analysis reveals that MutD can effectively extract protein
      mutation disease associations when benchmarking based on curated database
      records. The analysis also demonstrates that incorporating discourse level
      analysis significantly improved the performance of extracting the
      protein-mutation-disease association. Future work includes the extension of MutD 
      for full text articles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various information systems for medical curriculum mapping and
      harmonization have been developed and successfully applied to date. However, the 
      methods for exploiting the datasets captured inside the systems are rather
      lacking. METHOD: We reviewed the existing medical terminologies, nomenclatures,
      coding and classification systems in order to select the most suitable one and
      apply it in delivering visual analytic tools and reports for the benefit of
      medical curriculum designers and innovators. RESULTS: A formal description of a
      particular curriculum of general medicine is based on 1347 learning units
      covering 7075 learning outcomes. Two data-analytical reports have been developed 
      and discussed, showing how the curriculum is consistent with the MeSH thesaurus
      and how the MeSH thesaurus can be used to demonstrate interconnectivity of the
      curriculum through association analysis. CONCLUSION: Although the MeSH thesaurus 
      is designed mainly to index medical literature and support searching through
      bibliographic databases, we have proved its use in medical curriculum mapping as 
      being beneficial for curriculum designers and innovators. The presented approach 
      can be followed wherever needed to identify all the mandatory components used for
      transparent and comprehensive overview of medical curriculum data.

TI  - An application of MeSH enrichment analysis in livestock.
PG  - 381-7
LID - 10.1111/age.12307 [doi]
AB  - An integral part of functional genomics studies is to assess the enrichment of
      specific biological terms in lists of genes found to be playing an important role
      in biological phenomena. Contrasting the observed frequency of annotated terms
      with those of the background is at the core of overrepresentation analysis (ORA).
      Gene Ontology (GO) is a means to consistently classify and annotate gene products
      and has become a mainstay in ORA. Alternatively, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 
      offers a comprehensive life science vocabulary including additional categories
      that are not covered by GO. Although MeSH is applied predominantly in human and
      model organism research, its full potential in livestock genetics is yet to be
      explored. In this study, MeSH ORA was evaluated to discern biological properties 
      of identified genes and contrast them with the results obtained from GO
      enrichment analysis. Three published datasets were employed for this purpose,
      representing a gene expression study in dairy cattle, the use of SNPs for
      genome-wide prediction in swine and the identification of genomic regions
      targeted by selection in horses. We found that several overrepresented MeSH
      annotations linked to these gene sets share similar concepts with those of GO
      terms. Moreover, MeSH yielded unique annotations, which are not directly provided
      by GO terms, suggesting that MeSH has the potential to refine and enrich the
      representation of biological knowledge. We demonstrated that MeSH can be regarded
      as another choice of annotation to draw biological inferences from genes
      identified via experimental analyses. When used in combination with GO terms, our
      results indicate that MeSH can enhance our functional interpretations for
      specific biological conditions or the genetic basis of complex traits in
      livestock species.

TI  - An overview of the BIOASQ large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question
      answering competition.
PG  - 138
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0564-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This article provides an overview of the first BIOASQ challenge, a
      competition on large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering
      (QA), which took place between March and September 2013. BIOASQ assesses the
      ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical
      scientific articles, and to return concise and user-understandable answers to
      given natural language questions by combining information from biomedical
      articles and ontologies. RESULTS: The 2013 BIOASQ competition comprised two
      tasks, Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were asked to automatically
      annotate new PUBMED documents with MESH headings. Twelve teams participated in
      Task 1a, with a total of 46 system runs submitted, and one of the teams
      performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used by NLM to suggest MESH
      headings to curators. Task 1b used benchmark datasets containing 29 development
      and 282 test English questions, along with gold standard (reference) answers,
      prepared by a team of biomedical experts from around Europe and participants had 
      to automatically produce answers. Three teams participated in Task 1b, with 11
      system runs. The BIOASQ infrastructure, including benchmark datasets, evaluation 
      mechanisms, and the results of the participants and baseline methods, is publicly
      available. CONCLUSIONS: A publicly available evaluation infrastructure for
      biomedical semantic indexing and QA has been developed, which includes benchmark 
      datasets, and can be used to evaluate systems that: assign MESH headings to
      published articles or to English questions; retrieve relevant RDF triples from
      ontologies, relevant articles and snippets from PUBMED Central; produce "exact"
      and paragraph-sized "ideal" answers (summaries). The results of the systems that 
      participated in the 2013 BIOASQ competition are promising. In Task 1a one of the 
      systems performed consistently better from the NLM's MTI indexer. In Task 1b the 
      systems received high scores in the manual evaluation of the "ideal" answers;
      hence, they produced high quality summaries as answers. Overall, BIOASQ helped
      obtain a unified view of how techniques from text classification, semantic
      indexing, document and passage retrieval, question answering, and text
      summarization can be combined to allow biomedical experts to obtain concise,
      user-understandable answers to questions reflecting their real information needs.

TI  - Feature engineering for MEDLINE citation categorization with MeSH.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0539-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in biomedical text categorization has mostly used the
      bag-of-words representation. Other more sophisticated representations of text
      based on syntactic, semantic and argumentative properties have been less studied.
      In this paper, we evaluate the impact of different text representations of
      biomedical texts as features for reproducing the MeSH annotations of some of the 
      most frequent MeSH headings. In addition to unigrams and bigrams, these features 
      include noun phrases, citation meta-data, citation structure, and semantic
      annotation of the citations. RESULTS: Traditional features like unigrams and
      bigrams exhibit strong performance compared to other feature sets. Little or no
      improvement is obtained when using meta-data or citation structure. Noun phrases 
      are too sparse and thus have lower performance compared to more traditional
      features. Conceptual annotation of the texts by MetaMap shows similar performance
      compared to unigrams, but adding concepts from the UMLS taxonomy does not improve
      the performance of using only mapped concepts. The combination of all the
      features performs largely better than any individual feature set considered. In
      addition, this combination improves the performance of a state-of-the-art MeSH
      indexer. Concerning the machine learning algorithms, we find that those that are 
      more resilient to class imbalance largely obtain better performance. CONCLUSIONS:
      We conclude that even though traditional features such as unigrams and bigrams
      have strong performance compared to other features, it is possible to combine
      them to effectively improve the performance of the bag-of-words representation.
      We have also found that the combination of the learning algorithm and feature
      sets has an influence in the overall performance of the system. Moreover, using
      learning algorithms resilient to class imbalance largely improves performance.
      However, when using a large set of features, consideration needs to be taken with
      algorithms due to the risk of over-fitting. Specific combinations of learning
      algorithms and features for individual MeSH headings could further increase the
      performance of an indexing system.

TI  - MeSH ORA framework: R/Bioconductor packages to support MeSH over-representation
      analysis.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0453-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In genome-wide studies, over-representation analysis (ORA) against a 
      set of genes is an essential step for biological interpretation. Many gene
      annotation resources and software platforms for ORA have been proposed. Recently,
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, which are annotations of PubMed documents,
      have been used for ORA. MeSH enables the extraction of broader meaning from the
      gene lists and is expected to become an exhaustive annotation resource for ORA.
      However, the existing MeSH ORA software platforms are still not sufficient for
      several reasons. RESULTS: In this work, we developed an original MeSH ORA
      framework composed of six types of R packages, including MeSH.db, MeSH.AOR.db,
      MeSH.PCR.db, the org.MeSH.XXX.db-type packages, MeSHDbi, and meshr. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using our framework, users can easily conduct MeSH ORA. By utilizing the enriched
      MeSH terms, related PubMed documents can be retrieved and saved on local machines
      within this framework.

TI  - Building a gold standard to construct search filters: a case study with
      biomarkers for oral cancer.
PG  - 22-30
LID - 10.3163/1536-5050.103.1.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To support clinical researchers, librarians and informationists may
      need search filters for particular tasks. Development of filters typically
      depends on a "gold standard" dataset. This paper describes generalizable methods 
      for creating a gold standard to support future filter development and evaluation 
      using oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as a case study. OSCC is the most
      common malignancy affecting the oral cavity. Investigation of biomarkers with
      potential prognostic utility is an active area of research in OSCC. The methods
      discussed here should be useful for designing quality search filters in similar
      domains. METHODS: The authors searched MEDLINE for prognostic studies of OSCC,
      developed annotation guidelines for screeners, ran three calibration trials
      before annotating the remaining body of citations, and measured inter-annotator
      agreement (IAA). RESULTS: We retrieved 1,818 citations. After calibration, we
      screened the remaining citations (n = 1,767; 97.2%); IAA was substantial (kappa =
      0.76). The dataset has 497 (27.3%) citations representing OSCC studies of
      potential prognostic biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: The gold standard dataset is likely
      to be high quality and useful for future development and evaluation of filters
      for OSCC studies of potential prognostic biomarkers. IMPLICATIONS: The
      methodology we used is generalizable to other domains requiring a reference
      standard to evaluate the performance of search filters. A gold standard is
      essential because the labels regarding relevance enable computation of diagnostic
      metrics, such as sensitivity and specificity. Librarians and informationists with
      data analysis skills could contribute to developing gold standard datasets and
      subsequent filters tuned for their patrons' domains of interest.

TI  - Three journal similarity metrics and their application to biomedical journals.
PG  - e115681
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115681 [doi]
AB  - In the present paper, we have created several novel journal similarity metrics.
      The MeSH odds ratio measures the topical similarity of any pair of journals,
      based on the major MeSH headings assigned to articles in MEDLINE. The second
      metric employed the 2009 Author-ity author name disambiguation dataset as a gold 
      standard for estimating the author odds ratio. This gives a straightforward,
      intuitive answer to the question: Given two articles in PubMed that share the
      same author name (lastname, first initial), how does knowing only the identity of
      the journals (in which the articles were published) predict the relative
      likelihood that they are written by the same person vs. different persons? The
      article pair odds ratio detects the tendency of authors to publish repeatedly in 
      the same journal, as well as in specific pairs of journals. The metrics can be
      applied not only to estimate the similarity of a pair of journals, but to provide
      novel profiles of individual journals as well. For example, for each journal, one
      can define the MeSH cloud as the number of other journals that are topically more
      similar to it than expected by chance, and the author cloud as the number of
      other journals that share more authors than expected by chance. These metrics for
      journal pairs and individual journals have been provided in the form of public
      datasets that can be readily studied and utilized by others.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is the National Library of
      Medicine (NLM) controlled vocabulary for indexing articles. Inaccuracies in the
      MeSH thesaurus have been reported for several areas including pharmacy.
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of pharmacy-specific MeSH assignment to
      articles indexed in pharmacy journals. METHODS: The 10 journals containing the
      highest number of articles published in 2012 indexed under the MeSH 'Pharmacists'
      were identified. All articles published over a 5-year period (2008-2012) in the
      10 previously selected journals were retrieved from PubMed. MeSH terms used to
      index these articles were extracted and pharmacy-specific MeSH terms were
      identified. The frequency of use of pharmacy-specific MeSH terms was calculated
      across journals. RESULTS: A total of 6989 articles were retrieved from the 10
      pharmacy journals, of which 328 (4.7%) were articles not fully indexed and
      therefore did not contain any MeSH terms assigned. Among the 6661 articles fully 
      indexed, the mean number of MeSH terms was 10.1 (SD = 4.0), being 1.0 (SD = 1.3) 
      considered as Major MeSH. Both values significantly varied across journals. The
      mean number of pharmacy-specific MeSH terms per article was 0.9 (SD = 1.2). A
      total of 3490 (52.4%) of the 6661 articles were indexed in pharmacy journals
      without a single pharmacy-specific MeSH. Of the total 67193 MeSH terms assigned
      to articles, on average 10.5% (SD = 13.9) were pharmacy-specific MeSH. A
      statistically significant different pattern of pharmacy-specific MeSH assignment 
      was identified across journals (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      quality of assignment of the existing pharmacy-specific MeSH terms to articles
      indexed in pharmacy journals can be improved to further enhance evidence
      gathering in pharmacy. Over half of the articles published in the top-10 journals
      publishing pharmacy literature were indexed without a single pharmacy-specific
      MeSH.

AB  - PURPOSE: The completeness and utility of pharmacy-oriented Medical Subject
      Headings (MeSH) relative to MeSH terminology pertaining to other healthcare
      professions (dentistry and nursing) are evaluated. METHODS: The 2013 version of
      the MeSH thesaurus-the standard vocabulary used by the National Library of
      Medicine (NLM) to index articles in PubMed and MEDLINE-was searched for
      dentistry-, nursing-, and pharmacy-specific terms using a truncation strategy
      (search terms: nurs*, dent*, and pharm*); the hierarchical level of each term and
      the number of descendant terms (an indication of the granularity of the
      associated NLM-indexed content) were determined. PubMed searches were conducted
      to identify areas of the MeSH hierarchy containing dentistry- and
      nursing-specific terms but no equivalent pharmacy-specific term. RESULTS: The
      search of the MeSH thesaurus identified 145 terms representing dentistry-specific
      activities and 94 and 26 terms specific to nursing and pharmacy practice,
      respectively. Analysis of the three sets of MeSH terms indicated that
      dentistry-oriented MeSH terms were generally situated more prominently within the
      MeSH hierarchy than terms for nursing- and pharmacy-oriented research; the MeSH
      terminology oriented toward nursing or dentistry practice was relatively more
      granular, allowing for increased specificity and power of information retrieval
      during PubMed and MEDLINE searches. Seventeen proposed new MeSH terms describing 
      key areas of pharmacy practice were identified; the inclusion of these terms in
      the MeSH hierarchy could substantially expand and improve the retrievability of
      NLM-indexed literature. CONCLUSION: Imbalances and gaps were found in MeSH
      coverage of pharmacy concepts and terminology relative to MeSH terminology
      specific to the nursing and dentistry professions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eligibility criteria (EC) of clinical trials play a key role in
      selecting appropriate study candidates and the validity of the outcome of a
      clinical trial. However, in most cases EC are provided in unstandardised ways
      such as free text, which raises significant challenges for machine-readability.
      OBJECTIVES: To establish a list of most frequent medical concepts in clinical
      trials with semantic annotations. This concept list contributes to
      standardisation of EC and identifies relevant data items in electronic health
      records (EHRs) for clinical research. The coverage of the list in two major
      clinical vocabularies, MeSH and SNOMED-CT, will be assessed. METHODS: Four
      hundred and twenty-five clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2011 at a
      German university hospital were analysed. 6671 EC were manually annotated by a
      medical coder using Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) provided by the Unified
      Medical Language System. Two physicians performed a semi-automatic CUI code
      revision. Concept frequency was analysed and clusters of concepts were manually
      identified.A binomial significance test was applied to quantify coverage
      differences of the most frequent concepts in MeSH and SNOMED-CT. RESULTS: Based
      on manual medical coding of 425 clinical trials, 7588 concepts were identified,
      of which 5236 were distinct. A top 100 list containing 101 most frequent medical 
      concepts was established. The concepts of this list cover 25 % of all concept
      occurrences in all analysed clinical trials. This list reveals six missing
      entries in SNOMED-CT, 12 in MeSH. The median of EC frequency per trial has
      increased throughout the trial years (2000-2005: 8 EC/trial, 2011: 14 EC/trial). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Relatively few concepts cover one quarter of concept occurrences
      that represent EC in recent studies. Therefore, these concepts can serve as
      candidate data elements for integration into EHRs to optimise patient recruitment
      in clinical research.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze the research trends of medical informatics
      over the last 12 years. A new method based on MeSH terms was proposed to identify
      emerging topics and trends of medical informatics research. Informetric methods
      and visualization technologies were applied to investigate research trends of
      medical informatics. The metric of perspective factor (PF) embedding MeSH terms
      was appropriately employed to assess the perspective quality for journals. The
      emerging MeSH terms have changed dramatically over the last 12 years, identifying
      two stages of medical informatics: the "medical imaging stage" and the "medical
      informatics stage". The focus of medical informatics has shifted from acquisition
      and storage of healthcare data by integrating computational, informational,
      cognitive and organizational sciences to semantic analysis for problem solving
      and clinical decision-making. About 30 core journals were determined by
      Bradford's Law in the last 3 years in this area. These journals, with high PF
      values, have relative high perspective quality and lead the trend of medical
      informatics.

PG  - 950-4
AB  - The correct evaluation of research proposals continues today to be problematic,
      and in many cases, grants and fellowships are subjected to this type of
      assessment. A web based semi-automatic tool to help in the selection of reviewers
      was developed. The core of the proposed system is the matching of the MeSH
      Descriptors of the publications submitted by the reviewers (for their
      accreditation) and the Descriptor linked to the research keywords, which were
      selected. Moreover, a citation related index was further calculated and adopted
      in order to discard not suitable reviewers. This tool was used as a support in a 
      web site for the evaluation of candidates applying for a fellowship in the
      oncology field.

TI  - Link prediction in a MeSH co-occurrence network: preliminary results.
PG  - 579-83
AB  - Literature-based discovery (LBD) refers to automatic discovery of implicit
      relations from the scientific literature. Co-occurrence associations between
      biomedical concepts are commonly used in LBD. These co-occurrences can be
      represented as a network that consists of a set of nodes representing concepts
      and a set of edges representing their relationships (or links). In this paper we 
      propose and evaluate a methodology for link prediction of implicit connections in
      a network of co-occurring Medical Subject Headings (MeSH(R)). The proposed
      approach is complementary to, and may augment, existing LBD methods. Link
      prediction was performed using Jaccard and Adamic-Adar similarity measures. The
      preliminary results showed high prediction performance, with area under the ROC
      curve of 0.78 and 0.82 for the two similarity measures, respectively.

TI  - Computer based extraction of phenoptypic features of human congenital anomalies
      from the digital literature with natural language processing techniques.
PG  - 570-4
AB  - The lack of laboratory tests for the diagnosis of most of the congenital
      anomalies renders the physical examination of the case crucial for the diagnosis 
      of the anomaly; and the cases in the diagnostic phase are mostly being evaluated 
      in the light of the literature knowledge. In this respect, for accurate
      diagnosis, ,it is of great importance to provide the decision maker with decision
      support by presenting the literature knowledge about a particular case. Here, we 
      demonstrated a methodology for automated scanning and determining of the
      phenotypic features from the case reports related to congenital anomalies in the 
      literature with text and natural language processing methods, and we created a
      framework of an information source for a potential diagnostic decision support
      system for congenital anomalies.

TI  - High-performance information search filters for CKD content in PubMed, Ovid
      MEDLINE, and EMBASE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Finding relevant articles in large bibliographic databases such as
      PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and EMBASE to inform care and future research is
      challenging. Articles relevant to chronic kidney disease (CKD) are particularly
      difficult to find because they are often published under different terminology
      and are found across a wide range of journal types. STUDY DESIGN: We used
      computer automation within a diagnostic test assessment framework to develop and 
      validate information search filters to identify CKD articles in large
      bibliographic databases. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 22,992 full-text articles in
      PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, or EMBASE. INDEX TEST: 1,374,148 unique search filters.
      REFERENCE TEST: We established the reference standard of article relevance to CKD
      by manual review of all full-text articles using prespecified criteria to
      determine whether each article contained CKD content or not. We then assessed
      filter performance by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive
      predictive value for the retrieval of CKD articles. Filters with high sensitivity
      and specificity for the identification of CKD articles in the development phase
      (two-thirds of the sample) were then retested in the validation phase (remaining 
      one-third of the sample). RESULTS: We developed and validated high-performance
      CKD search filters for each bibliographic database. Filters optimized for
      sensitivity reached at least 99% sensitivity, and filters optimized for
      specificity reached at least 97% specificity. The filters were complex; for
      example, one PubMed filter included more than 89 terms used in combination,
      including "chronic kidney disease," "renal insufficiency," and "renal fibrosis." 
      In proof-of-concept searches, physicians found more articles relevant to the
      topic of CKD with the use of these filters. LIMITATIONS: As knowledge of the
      pathogenesis of CKD grows and definitions change, these filters will need to be
      updated to incorporate new terminology used to index relevant articles.
      CONCLUSIONS: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and EMBASE can be filtered reliably for
      articles relevant to CKD. These high-performance information filters are now
      available online and can be used to better identify CKD content in large
      bibliographic databases.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0102188 [doi]
AB  - Concept associations can be represented by a network that consists of a set of
      nodes representing concepts and a set of edges representing their relationships. 
      Complex networks exhibit some common topological features including small
      diameter, high degree of clustering, power-law degree distribution, and
      modularity. We investigated the topological properties of a network constructed
      from co-occurrences between MeSH descriptors in the MEDLINE database. We
      conducted the analysis on two networks, one constructed from all MeSH descriptors
      and another using only major descriptors. Network reduction was performed using
      the Pearson's chi-square test for independence. To characterize topological
      properties of the network we adopted some specific measures, including diameter, 
      average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. For the
      full MeSH network the average path length was 1.95 with a diameter of three edges
      and clustering coefficient of 0.26. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the power
      law as a plausible model for degree distribution. For the major MeSH network the 
      average path length was 2.63 edges with a diameter of seven edges and clustering 
      coefficient of 0.15. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test failed to reject the power law
      as a plausible model. The power-law exponent was 5.07. In both networks it was
      evident that nodes with a lower degree exhibit higher clustering than those with 
      a higher degree. After simulated attack, where we removed 10% of nodes with the
      highest degrees, the giant component of each of the two networks contains about
      90% of all nodes. Because of small average path length and high degree of
      clustering the MeSH network is small-world. A power-law distribution is not a
      plausible model for the degree distribution. The network is highly modular,
      highly resistant to targeted and random attack and with minimal dissortativity.

TI  - Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for indexing and retrieving open-source
      healthcare data.
PG  - 157-60
AB  - The US federal government initiated the Open Government Directive where federal
      agencies are required to publish high value datasets so that they are available
      to the public. Data.gov and the community site Healthdata.gov were initiated to
      disperse such datasets. However, data searches and retrieval for these sites are 
      keyword driven and severely limited in performance. The purpose of this paper is 
      to address the issue of extracting relevant open-source data by proposing a
      method of adopting the MeSH framework for indexing and data retrieval. A pilot
      study was conducted to compare the performance of traditional keywords to MeSH
      terms for retrieving relevant open-source datasets related to "mortality". The
      MeSH framework resulted in greater sensitivity with comparable specificity to the
      keyword search. MeSH showed promise as a method for indexing and retrieving data,
      yet future research should conduct a larger scale evaluation of the performance
      of the MeSH framework for retrieving relevant open-source healthcare datasets.

TI  - A novel method for gathering and prioritizing disease candidate genes based on
      construction of a set of disease-related MeSH(R) terms.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-15-179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in disease is
      critical for the development of more effective and individualized strategies for 
      prevention and treatment. The amount of disease-related literature, including new
      genetic information on the molecular mechanisms of disease, is rapidly
      increasing. Extracting beneficial information from literature can be facilitated 
      by computational methods such as the knowledge-discovery approach. Several
      methods for mining gene-disease relationships using computational methods have
      been developed, however, there has been a lack of research evaluating specific
      disease candidate genes. RESULTS: We present a novel method for gathering and
      prioritizing specific disease candidate genes. Our approach involved the
      construction of a set of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for the effective 
      retrieval of publications related to a disease candidate gene. Information
      regarding the relationships between genes and publications was obtained from the 
      gene2pubmed database. The set of genes was prioritized using a "weighted
      literature score" based on the number of publications and weighted by the number 
      of genes occurring in a publication. Using our method for the disease states of
      pain and Alzheimer's disease, a total of 1101 pain candidate genes and 2810
      Alzheimer's disease candidate genes were gathered and prioritized. The precision 
      was 0.30 and the recall was 0.89 in the case study of pain. The precision was
      0.04 and the recall was 0.6 in the case study of Alzheimer's disease. The
      precision-recall curve indicated that the performance of our method was superior 
      to that of other publicly available tools. CONCLUSIONS: Our method, which
      involved the use of a set of MeSH terms related to disease candidate genes and a 
      novel weighted literature score, improved the accuracy of gathering and
      prioritizing candidate genes by focusing on a specific disease.

PG  - 236-44
LID - 10.11607/ijp.3633 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexing of articles that 
      employed time-to-event analyses to report outcomes of dental treatment in
      patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published in 2008 in 50 dental journals
      with the highest impact factors were hand searched to identify articles reporting
      dental treatment outcomes over time in human subjects with time-to-event
      statistics (included, n = 95), without time-to-event statistics (active controls,
      n = 91), and all other articles (passive controls, n = 6,769). The search was
      systematic (kappa 0.92 for screening, 0.86 for eligibility). Outcome-, statistic-
      and time-related MeSH were identified, and differences in allocation between
      groups were analyzed with chi-square and Fischer exact statistics. RESULTS: The
      most frequently allocated MeSH for included and active control articles were
      "dental restoration failure" (77% and 52%, respectively) and "treatment outcome" 
      (54% and 48%, respectively). Outcome MeSH was similar between these groups (86%
      and 77%, respectively) and significantly greater than passive controls (10%, P < 
      .001). Significantly more statistical MeSH were allocated to the included
      articles than to the active or passive controls (67%, 15%, and 1%, respectively, 
      P < .001). Sixty-nine included articles specifically used Kaplan-Meier or life
      table analyses, but only 42% (n = 29) were indexed as such. Significantly more
      time-related MeSH were allocated to the included than the active controls (92%
      and 79%, respectively, P = .02), or to the passive controls (22%, P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: MeSH allocation within MEDLINE to time-to-event dental articles was 
      inaccurate and inconsistent. Statistical MeSH were omitted from 30% of the
      included articles and incorrectly allocated to 15% of active controls. Such
      errors adversely impact search accuracy.

TI  - Genealogical-based method for multiple ontology self-extension in MeSH.
PG  - 124-30
LID - 10.1109/TNB.2014.2320413 [doi]
AB  - During the last decade, the advent of Ontologies used for biomedical annotation
      has had a deep impact on life science. MeSH is a well-known Ontology for the
      purpose of indexing journal articles in PubMed, improving literature searching on
      multi-domain topics. Since the explosion of data growth in recent years, there
      are new terms, concepts that weed through the old and bring forth the new.
      Automatically extending sets of existing terms will enable bio-curators to
      systematically improve text-based ontologies level by level. However, most of the
      related techniques which apply symbolic patterns based on a literature corpus
      tend to focus on more general but not specific parts of the ontology. Therefore, 
      in this work, we present a novel method for utilizing genealogical information
      from Ontology itself to find suitable siblings for ontology extension. Based on
      the breadth and depth dimensions, the sibling generation stage and pruning
      strategy are proposed in our approach. As a result, on the average, the precision
      of the genealogical-based method achieved 0.5, with the best 0.83 performance of 
      category "Organisms." We also achieve average precision 0.69 of 229 new terms in 
      MeSH 2013 version.

TI  - Mapping the structure and dynamics of genomics-related MeSH terms complex
      networks.
PG  - e92639

AB  - It has been proposed that the history and evolution of scientific ideas may
      reflect certain aspects of the underlying socio-cognitive frameworks in which
      science itself is developing. Systematic analyses of the development of
      scientific knowledge may help us to construct models of the collective dynamics
      of science. Aiming at scientific rigor, these models should be built upon solid
      empirical evidence, analyzed with formal tools leading to ever-improving results 
      that support the related conclusions. Along these lines we studied the dynamics
      and structure of the development of research in genomics as represented by the
      entire collection of genomics-related scientific papers contained in the PubMed
      database. The analyzed corpus consisted in more than 49,000 articles published in
      the years 1987 (first appearance of the term Genomics) to 2011, categorized by
      means of the Medical Subheadings (MeSH) content-descriptors. Complex networks
      were built where two MeSH terms were connected if they are descriptors of the
      same article(s). The analysis of such networks revealed a complex structure and
      dynamics that to certain extent resembled small-world networks. The evolution of 
      such networks in time reflected interesting phenomena in the historical
      development of genomic research, including what seems to be a phase-transition in
      a period marked by the completion of the first draft of the Human Genome Project.
      We also found that different disciplinary areas have different dynamic evolution 
      patterns in their MeSH connectivity networks. In the case of areas related to
      science, changes in topology were somewhat fast while retaining a certain
      core-structure, whereas in the humanities, the evolution was pretty slow and the 
      structure resulted highly redundant and in the case of technology related issues,
      the evolution was very fast and the structure remained tree-like with almost no
      overlapping terms.

AB  - Although the basic PubMed search is often helpful, the results may sometimes be
      non-specific. For more control over the search process you can use the Advanced
      Search Builder interface. This allows a targeted search in specific fields, with 
      the convenience of being able to select the intended search field from a list. It
      also provides a history of your previous searches. The search history is useful
      to develop a complex search query by combining several previous searches using
      Boolean operators. For indexing the articles in MEDLINE, the NLM uses a
      controlled vocabulary system called MeSH. This standardised vocabulary solves the
      problem of authors, researchers and librarians who may use different terms for
      the same concept. To be efficient in a PubMed search, you should start by
      identifying the most appropriate MeSH terms and use them in your search where
      possible. My NCBI is a personal workspace facility available through PubMed and
      makes it possible to customise the PubMed interface. It provides various
      capabilities that can enhance your search performance.

TI  - A genome-wide MeSH-based literature mining system predicts implicit gene-to-gene 
      relationships and networks.
PG  - S9
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-7-S3-S9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The large amount of literature in the post-genomics era enables the
      study of gene interactions and networks using all available articles published
      for a specific organism. MeSH is a controlled vocabulary of medical and
      scientific terms that is used by biomedical scientists to manually index articles
      in the PubMed literature database. We hypothesized that genome-wide gene-MeSH
      term associations from the PubMed literature database could be used to predict
      implicit gene-to-gene relationships and networks. While the gene-MeSH
      associations have been used to detect gene-gene interactions in some studies,
      different methods have not been well compared, and such a strategy has not been
      evaluated for a genome-wide literature analysis. Genome-wide literature mining of
      gene-to-gene interactions allows ranking of the best gene interactions and
      investigation of comprehensive biological networks at a genome level. RESULTS:
      The genome-wide GenoMesh literature mining algorithm was developed by
      sequentially generating a gene-article matrix, a normalized gene-MeSH term
      matrix, and a gene-gene matrix. The gene-gene matrix relies on the calculation of
      pairwise gene dissimilarities based on gene-MeSH relationships. An optimized
      dissimilarity score was identified from six well-studied functions based on a
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Based on the studies with
      well-studied Escherichia coli and less-studied Brucella spp., GenoMesh was found 
      to accurately identify gene functions using weighted MeSH terms, predict
      gene-gene interactions not reported in the literature, and cluster all the genes 
      studied from an organism using the MeSH-based gene-gene matrix. A web-based
      GenoMesh literature mining program is also available at:
      http://genomesh.hegroup.org. GenoMesh also predicts gene interactions and
      networks among genes associated with specific MeSH terms or user-selected gene
      lists. CONCLUSIONS: The GenoMesh algorithm and web program provide the first
      genome-wide, MeSH-based literature mining system that effectively predicts
      implicit gene-gene interaction relationships and networks in a genome-wide scope.

TI  - Comparison and combination of several MeSH indexing approaches.
PG  - 709-18
AB  - MeSH indexing of MEDLINE is becoming a more difficult task for the group of
      highly qualified indexing staff at the US National Library of Medicine, due to
      the large yearly growth of MEDLINE and the increasing size of MeSH. Since 2002,
      this task has been assisted by the Medical Text Indexer or MTI program. We extend
      previous machine learning analysis by adding a more diverse set of MeSH headings 
      targeting examples where MTI has been shown to perform poorly. Machine learning
      algorithms exceed MTI's performance on MeSH headings that are used very
      frequently and headings for which the indexing frequency is very low. We find
      that when we combine the MTI suggestions and the prediction of the learning
      algorithms, the performance improves compared to any single method for most of
      the evaluated MeSH headings.

TI  - Mining MEDLINE for problems associated with vitamin D.
PG  - 300-8
AB  - This paper presents a two-step approach to generating comprehensive abstractive
      overviews for biomedical topics. It starts with a sensitivity-maximizing search
      of MEDLINE/PubMed and MeSH-based filtering of the results that are then processed
      using NLP methods to extract relations between entities of interest. We evaluate 
      this approach in a case study based on the IOM report on the role of vitamin D in
      human health. The report defines disorders that serve as health indicators for
      the role of vitamin D. We evaluate the abstractive overviews generated using MeSH
      indexing and the extracted relations using the disorders listed in the IOM report
      as reference standard. We conclude that MeSH-based aggregation and filtering of
      the results is a useful and easy step in the generation of abstractive overviews.
      Although our relation extraction achieved 83.6% recall and 92.8% precision, only 
      half of the disorders of interest participated in these relations.

TI  - PubMedMiner: Mining and Visualizing MeSH-based Associations in PubMed.
PG  - 1990-9
AB  - The exponential growth of biomedical literature provides the opportunity to
      develop approaches for facilitating the identification of possible relationships 
      between biomedical concepts. Indexing by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
      represent high-quality summaries of much of this literature that can be used to
      support hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery tasks using techniques such
      as association rule mining. Based on a survey of literature mining tools, a tool 
      implemented using Ruby and R - PubMedMiner - was developed in this study for
      mining and visualizing MeSH-based associations for a set of MEDLINE articles. To 
      demonstrate PubMedMiner's functionality, a case study was conducted that focused 
      on identifying and comparing comorbidities for asthma in children and adults.
      Relative to the tools surveyed, the initial results suggest that PubMedMiner
      provides complementary functionality for summarizing and comparing topics as well
      as identifying potentially new knowledge.

TI  - Desiderata for an authoritative Representation of MeSH in RDF.
PG  - 1218-27
AB  - The Semantic Web provides a framework for the integration of resources on the
      web, which facilitates information integration and interoperability. RDF is the
      main representation format for Linked Open Data (LOD). However, datasets are not 
      always made available in RDF by their producers and the Semantic Web community
      has had to convert some of these datasets to RDF in order for these datasets to
      participate in the LOD cloud. As a result, the LOD cloud sometimes contains
      outdated, partial and even inaccurate RDF datasets. We review the LOD landscape
      for one of these resources, MeSH, and analyze the characteristics of six existing
      representations in order to identify desirable features for an authoritative
      version, for which we create a prototype. We illustrate the suitability of this
      prototype on three common use cases. NLM intends to release an authoritative
      representation of MeSH in RDF (beta version) in the Fall of 2014.

TI  - Stochastic Gradient Descent and the Prediction of MeSH for PubMed Records.
PG  - 1198-207
AB  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has gained popularity for solving large scale
      supervised machine learning problems. It provides a rapid method for minimizing a
      number of loss functions and is applicable to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
      Logistic optimizations. However SGD does not provide a convenient stopping
      criterion. Generally an optimal number of iterations over the data may be
      determined using held out data. Here we compare stopping predictions based on
      held out data with simply stopping at a fixed number of iterations and show that 
      the latter works as well as the former for a number of commonly studied text
      classification problems. In particular fixed stopping works well for MeSH((R))
      predictions on PubMed((R)) records. We also surveyed the published algorithms for
      SVM learning on large data sets, and chose three for comparison: PROBE, SVMperf, 
      and Liblinear and compared them with SGD with a fixed number of iterations. We
      find SGD with a fixed number of iterations performs as well as these alternative 
      methods and is much faster to compute. As an application we made SGD-SVM
      predictions for all MeSH terms and used the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV)
      algorithm to convert these predictions to probabilities. Such probabilistic
      predictions lead to ranked MeSH term predictions superior to previously published
      results on two test sets.

TI  - SemInf: a burst-based semantic influence model for biomedical topic influence.
PG  - 508-14
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2013.2285875 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we model how biomedical topics influence one another, given they
      are organized in a topic hierarchy, medical subject headings, in which the edges 
      capture a parent-child/subsumption relationship among topics. This information
      enables studying influence of topics from a semantic perspective, which might be 
      very important in analyzing topic evolution and is missing from the current
      literature. We first define a burst-based action for topics, which models upward 
      momentum in popularity (or "elevated occurrences" of the topics), and use it to
      define two types of influence: accumulation influence and propagation influence. 
      We then propose a model of influence between topics, and develop an efficient
      algorithm (TIPS) to identify influential topics. Experiments show that our model 
      is successful at identifying influential topics and the algorithm is very
      efficient.

TI  - How to improve your PubMed/MEDLINE searches: 1. background and basic searching.
PG  - 479-86
LID - 10.1177/1357633X13512061 [doi]
AB  - PubMed provides free access via the Internet to more than 23 million records, of 
      which over 19 million are from the MEDLINE database of journal articles. PubMed
      also provides access to other databases, such as the NCBI Bookshelf. To perform a
      basic search, you can simply enter the search terms or the concept that you are
      looking for in the search box. However, taking care to clarify your key concepts 
      may save much time later on, because a non-specific search is likely to produce
      an overwhelming number of result hits. One way to make your search more specific 
      is to specify which field you want to search using field tags. By default, the
      results of a search are sorted by the date added to PubMed and displayed in
      summary format with 20 result hits (records) on each page. In summary format, the
      title of the article, list of authors, source of information (e.g., journal name 
      followed by date of publication, volume, issue, pages) and the unique PubMed
      record number called the PubMed identifier (PMID) are shown. Although information
      is stored about the articles, PubMed/MEDLINE does not store the full text of the 
      papers themselves. However, PubMedCentral (PMC) stores more than 2.8 million
      articles (roughly 10% of the articles in PubMed) and provides access to them for 
      free to the users.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0077910 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput sequencing technology, also called next-generation sequencing
      (NGS), has the potential to revolutionize the whole process of genome sequencing,
      transcriptomics, and epigenetics. Sequencing data is captured in a public primary
      data archive, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). As of January 2013, data from more
      than 14,000 projects have been submitted to SRA, which is double that of the
      previous year. Researchers can download raw sequence data from SRA website to
      perform further analyses and to compare with their own data. However, it is
      extremely difficult to search entries and download raw sequences of interests
      with SRA because the data structure is complicated, and experimental conditions
      along with raw sequences are partly described in natural language. Additionally, 
      some sequences are of inconsistent quality because anyone can submit sequencing
      data to SRA with no quality check. Therefore, as a criterion of data quality, we 
      focused on SRA entries that were cited in journal articles. We extracted SRA IDs 
      and PubMed IDs (PMIDs) from SRA and full-text versions of journal articles and
      retrieved 2748 SRA ID-PMID pairs. We constructed a publication list referring to 
      SRA entries. Since, one of the main themes of -omics analyses is clarification of
      disease mechanisms, we also characterized SRA entries by disease keywords,
      according to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) extracted from articles assigned
      to each SRA entry. We obtained 989 SRA ID-MeSH disease term pairs, and
      constructed a disease list referring to SRA data. We previously developed feature
      profiles of diseases in a system called "Gendoo". We generated hyperlinks between
      diseases extracted from SRA and the feature profiles of it. The developed
      project, publication and disease lists resulting from this study are available at
      our web service, called "DBCLS SRA" (http://sra.dbcls.jp/). This service will
      improve accessibility to high-quality data from SRA.

TI  - PubMed search strings for the study of agricultural workers' diseases.
PG  - 1473-81
LID - 10.1002/ajim.22252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several optimized search strategies have been developed in Medicine, 
      and more recently in Occupational Medicine. The aim of this study was to identify
      efficient PubMed search strategies to retrieve articles regarding putative
      occupational determinants of agricultural workers' diseases. METHODS: We selected
      the Medical Subjects Heading (MeSH) term agricultural workers' diseases and six
      MeSH terms describing farm work (agriculture, agrochemicals NOT pesticides,
      animal husbandry, pesticides, rural health, rural population) alongside 61 other 
      promising terms. We estimated proportions of articles containing potentially
      pertinent information regarding occupational etiology to formulate two search
      strategies (one "more specific," one "more sensitive"). We applied these
      strategies to retrieve information on the possible occupational etiology among
      agricultural workers of kidney cancer, knee osteoarthritis, and multiple
      sclerosis. We evaluated the number of needed to read (NNR) abstracts to identify 
      one potentially pertinent article in the context of these pathologies. RESULTS:
      The "more specific" search string was based on the combination of terms that
      yielded the highest proportion (40%) of potentially pertinent abstracts. The
      "more sensitive" string was based on use of broader search fields and additional 
      coverage provided by other search terms under study. Using the "more specific"
      string, the NNR to find one potentially pertinent article were: 1.1 for kidney
      cancer; 1.4 for knee osteoarthritis; 1.2 for multiple sclerosis. Using the
      sensitive strategy, the NNR were 1.4, 3.6, and 6.3, respectively. CONCLUSION: The
      proposed strings could help health care professionals explore putative
      occupational etiology for agricultural workers' diseases (even if not generally
      thought to be work related).

TI  - Use of controlled vocabularies to improve biomedical information retrieval tasks.
PG  - 1068
AB  - The high heterogeneity of biomedical vocabulary is a major obstacle for
      information retrieval in large biomedical collections. Therefore, using
      biomedical controlled vocabularies is crucial for managing these contents. We
      investigate the impact of query expansion based on controlled vocabularies to
      improve the effectiveness of two search engines. Our strategy relies on the
      enrichment of users' queries with additional terms, directly derived from such
      vocabularies applied to infectious diseases and chemical patents. We observed
      that query expansion based on pathogen names resulted in improvements of the
      top-precision of our first search engine, while the normalization of diseases
      degraded the top-precision. The expansion of chemical entities, which was
      performed on the second search engine, positively affected the mean average
      precision. We have shown that query expansion of some types of biomedical
      entities has a great potential to improve search effectiveness; therefore a
      fine-tuning of query expansion strategies could help improving the performances
      of search engines.

TI  - Efficient Semisupervised MEDLINE Document Clustering With MeSH-Semantic and
      Global-Content Constraints.
PG  - 1265-76
LID - 10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2227998 [doi]
AB  - For clustering biomedical documents, we can consider three different types of
      information: the local-content (LC) information from documents, the
      global-content (GC) information from the whole MEDLINE collections, and the
      medical subject heading (MeSH)-semantic (MS) information. Previous methods for
      clustering biomedical documents are not necessarily effective for integrating
      different types of information, by which only one or two types of information
      have been used. Recently, the performance of MEDLINE document clustering has been
      enhanced by linearly combining both the LC and MS information. However, the
      simple linear combination could be ineffective because of the limitation of the
      representation space for combining different types of information (similarities) 
      with different reliability. To overcome the limitation, we propose a new
      semisupervised spectral clustering method, i.e., SSNCut, for clustering over the 
      LC similarities, with two types of constraints: must-link (ML) constraints on
      document pairs with high MS (or GC) similarities and cannot-link (CL) constraints
      on those with low similarities. We empirically demonstrate the performance of
      SSNCut on MEDLINE document clustering, by using 100 data sets of MEDLINE records.
      Experimental results show that SSNCut outperformed a linear combination method
      and several well-known semisupervised clustering methods, being statistically
      significant. Furthermore, the performance of SSNCut with constraints from both MS
      and GC similarities outperformed that from only one type of similarities. Another
      interesting finding was that ML constraints more effectively worked than CL
      constraints, since CL constraints include around 10% incorrect ones, whereas this
      number was only 1% for ML constraints.

TI  - Compensating for literature annotation bias when predicting novel drug-disease
      relationships through Medical Subject Heading Over-representation Profile
      (MeSHOP) similarity.
PG  - S3
LID - 10.1186/1755-8794-6-S2-S3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using annotations to the articles in MEDLINE(R)/PubMed(R), over six
      thousand chemical compounds with pharmacological actions have been tracked since 
      1996. Medical Subject Heading Over-representation Profiles (MeSHOPs)
      quantitatively leverage the literature associated with biological entities such
      as diseases or drugs, providing the opportunity to reposition known compounds
      towards novel disease applications. METHODS: A MeSHOP is constructed by counting 
      the number of times each medical subject term is assigned to an entity-related
      research publication in the MEDLINE database and calculating the significance of 
      the count by comparing against the count of the term in a background set of
      publications. Based on the expectation that drugs suitable for treatment of a
      disease (or disease symptom) will have similar annotation properties to the
      disease, we successfully predict drug-disease associations by comparing MeSHOPs
      of diseases and drugs. RESULTS: The MeSHOP comparison approach delivers an 11%
      improvement over bibliometric baselines. However, novel drug-disease associations
      are observed to be biased towards drugs and diseases with more publications. To
      account for the annotation biases, a correction procedure is introduced and
      evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: By explicitly accounting for the annotation bias,
      unexpectedly similar drug-disease pairs are highlighted as candidates for drug
      repositioning research. MeSHOPs are shown to provide a literature-supported
      perspective for discovery of new links between drugs and diseases based on
      pre-existing knowledge.

TI  - MeSH indexing based on automatically generated summaries.
PG  - 208
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-14-208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MEDLINE citations are manually indexed at the U.S. National Library
      of Medicine (NLM) using as reference the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
      controlled vocabulary. For this task, the human indexers read the full text of
      the article. Due to the growth of MEDLINE, the NLM Indexing Initiative explores
      indexing methodologies that can support the task of the indexers. Medical Text
      Indexer (MTI) is a tool developed by the NLM Indexing Initiative to provide MeSH 
      indexing recommendations to indexers. Currently, the input to MTI is MEDLINE
      citations, title and abstract only. Previous work has shown that using full text 
      as input to MTI increases recall, but decreases precision sharply. We propose
      using summaries generated automatically from the full text for the input to MTI
      to use in the task of suggesting MeSH headings to indexers. Summaries distill the
      most salient information from the full text, which might increase the coverage of
      automatic indexing approaches based on MEDLINE. We hypothesize that if the
      results were good enough, manual indexers could possibly use automatic summaries 
      instead of the full texts, along with the recommendations of MTI, to speed up the
      process while maintaining high quality of indexing results. RESULTS: We have
      generated summaries of different lengths using two different summarizers, and
      evaluated the MTI indexing on the summaries using different algorithms: MTI,
      individual MTI components, and machine learning. The results are compared to
      those of full text articles and MEDLINE citations. Our results show that
      automatically generated summaries achieve similar recall but higher precision
      compared to full text articles. Compared to MEDLINE citations, summaries achieve 
      higher recall but lower precision. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that automatic
      summaries produce better indexing than full text articles. Summaries produce
      similar recall to full text but much better precision, which seems to indicate
      that automatic summaries can efficiently capture the most important contents
      within the original articles. The combination of MEDLINE citations and
      automatically generated summaries could improve the recommendations suggested by 
      MTI. On the other hand, indexing performance might be dependent on the MeSH
      heading being indexed. Summarization techniques could thus be considered as a
      feature selection algorithm that might have to be tuned individually for each
      MeSH heading.

AB  - PURPOSE: Previous research has shown that information seekers in biomedical
      domain need more support in formulating their queries. A user study was conducted
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a metadata based query suggestion interface for 
      PubMed bibliographic search. The study also investigated the impact of search
      task familiarity on search behaviors and the effectiveness of the interface.
      METHODS: A real user, user search request and real system approach was used for
      the study. Unlike tradition IR evaluation, where assigned tasks were used, the
      participants were asked to search requests of their own. Forty-four researchers
      in Health Sciences participated in the evaluation - each conducted two research
      requests of their own, alternately with the proposed interface and the PubMed
      baseline. Several performance criteria were measured to assess the potential
      benefits of the experimental interface, including users' assessment of their
      original and eventual queries, the perceived usefulness of the interfaces,
      satisfaction with the search results, and the average relevance score of the
      saved records. RESULTS: The results show that, when searching for an unfamiliar
      topic, users were more likely to change their queries, indicating the effect of
      familiarity on search behaviors. The results also show that the interface scored 
      higher on several of the performance criteria, such as the "goodness" of the
      queries, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction. Furthermore, in line with
      our hypothesis, the proposed interface was relatively more effective when less
      familiar search requests were attempted. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that there
      is a selective compatibility between search familiarity and search interface. One
      implication of the research for system evaluation is the importance of taking
      into consideration task familiarity when assessing the effectiveness of
      interactive IR systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the extent to which comparative effectiveness research
      (CER) organizations share terms for designs, analyzed coverage of CER designs in 
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Emtree, and explored whether scientists use
      CER design terms. METHODS: We developed local terminologies (LTs) and a CER
      design terminology by extracting terms in documents from five organizations. We
      defined coverage as the distribution over match type in MeSH and Emtree. We
      created a crosswalk by recording terms to which design terms mapped in both
      controlled vocabularies. We analyzed the hits for queries restricted to titles
      and abstracts to explore scientists' language. RESULTS: Pairwise LT overlap
      ranged from 22.64% (12/53) to 75.61% (31/41). The CER design terminology (n = 78 
      terms) consisted of terms for primary study designs and a few terms useful for
      evaluating evidence, such as opinion paper and systematic review. Patterns of
      coverage were similar in MeSH and Emtree (gamma = 0.581, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS:
      Stakeholder terminologies vary, and terms are inconsistently covered in MeSH and 
      Emtree. The CER design terminology and crosswalk may be useful for expert
      searchers. For partially mapped terms, queries could consist of free text for
      modifiers such as nonrandomized or interrupted added to broad or related
      controlled terms.

      information retrieval processes in biomedical domain. The use of biomedical
      ontologies facilitated the combination of various data sources (e.g. scientific
      literature, clinical data repository) by increasing the quality of information
      retrieval and reducing the maintenance efforts. In this context, we developed
      Ontology Look-up services (OLS), based on NEWT and MeSH vocabularies. Our
      services were involved in some information retrieval tasks such as gene/disease
      normalization. The implementation of OLS services significantly accelerated the
      extraction of particular biomedical facts by structuring and enriching the data
      context. The results of precision in normalization tasks were boosted on about
      20%.

TI  - Deterministic binary vectors for efficient automated indexing of MEDLINE/PubMed
      abstracts.
PG  - 940-9
AB  - The need to maintain accessibility of the biomedical literature has led to
      development of methods to assist human indexers by recommending index terms for
      newly encountered articles. Given the rapid expansion of this literature, it is
      essential that these methods be scalable. Document vector representations are
      commonly used for automated indexing, and Random Indexing (RI) provides the means
      to generate them efficiently. However, RI is difficult to implement in real-world
      indexing systems, as (1) efficient nearest-neighbor search requires retaining all
      document vectors in RAM, and (2) it is necessary to maintain a store of randomly 
      generated term vectors to index future documents. Motivated by these concerns,
      this paper documents the development and evaluation of a deterministic binary
      variant of RI. The increased capacity demonstrated by binary vectors has
      implications for information retrieval, and the elimination of the need to retain
      term vectors facilitates distributed implementations, enhancing the scalability
      of RI.

TI  - Semantic similarity in the biomedical domain: an evaluation across knowledge
      sources.
PG  - 261
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-13-261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Semantic similarity measures estimate the similarity between
      concepts, and play an important role in many text processing tasks. Approaches to
      semantic similarity in the biomedical domain can be roughly divided into
      knowledge based and distributional based methods. Knowledge based approaches
      utilize knowledge sources such as dictionaries, taxonomies, and semantic
      networks, and include path finding measures and intrinsic information content
      (IC) measures. Distributional measures utilize, in addition to a knowledge
      source, the distribution of concepts within a corpus to compute similarity; these
      include corpus IC and context vector methods. Prior evaluations of these measures
      in the biomedical domain showed that distributional measures outperform knowledge
      based path finding methods; but more recent studies suggested that intrinsic IC
      based measures exceed the accuracy of distributional approaches. Limitations of
      previous evaluations of similarity measures in the biomedical domain include
      their focus on the SNOMED CT ontology, and their reliance on small benchmarks not
      powered to detect significant differences between measure accuracy. There have
      been few evaluations of the relative performance of these measures on other
      biomedical knowledge sources such as the UMLS, and on larger, recently developed 
      semantic similarity benchmarks. RESULTS: We evaluated knowledge based and corpus 
      IC based semantic similarity measures derived from SNOMED CT, MeSH, and the UMLS 
      on recently developed semantic similarity benchmarks. Semantic similarity
      measures based on the UMLS, which contains SNOMED CT and MeSH, significantly
      outperformed those based solely on SNOMED CT or MeSH across evaluations.
      Intrinsic IC based measures significantly outperformed path-based and
      distributional measures. We released all code required to reproduce our results
      and all tools developed as part of this study as open source, available under
      http://code.google.com/p/ytex. We provide a publicly-accessible web service to
      compute semantic similarity, available under
      http://informatics.med.yale.edu/ytex.web/. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge based semantic 
      similarity measures are more practical to compute than distributional measures,
      as they do not require an external corpus. Furthermore, knowledge based measures 
      significantly and meaningfully outperformed distributional measures on large
      semantic similarity benchmarks, suggesting that they are a practical alternative 
      to distributional measures. Future evaluations of semantic similarity measures
      should utilize benchmarks powered to detect significant differences in measure
      accuracy.

      over-representation profiles (MeSHOPs).
PG  - 249
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-13-249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MEDLINE(R)/PubMed(R) indexes over 20 million biomedical articles,
      providing curated annotation of its contents using a controlled vocabulary known 
      as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The MeSH vocabulary, developed over 50+
      years, provides a broad coverage of topics across biomedical research. Distilling
      the essential biomedical themes for a topic of interest from the relevant
      literature is important to both understand the importance of related concepts and
      discover new relationships. RESULTS: We introduce a novel method for determining 
      enriched curator-assigned MeSH annotations in a set of papers associated to a
      topic, such as a gene, an author or a disease. We generate MeSH
      Over-representation Profiles (MeSHOPs) to quantitatively summarize the
      annotations in a form convenient for further computational analysis and
      visualization. Based on a hypergeometric distribution of assigned terms, MeSHOPs 
      statistically account for the prevalence of the associated biomedical annotation 
      while highlighting unusually prevalent terms based on a specified background.
      MeSHOPs can be visualized using word clouds, providing a succinct quantitative
      graphical representation of the relative importance of terms. Using the
      publication dates of articles, MeSHOPs track changing patterns of annotation over
      time. Since MeSHOPs are quantitative vectors, MeSHOPs can be compared using
      standard techniques such as hierarchical clustering. The reliability of MeSHOP
      annotations is assessed based on the capacity to re-derive the subset of the Gene
      Ontology annotations with equivalent MeSH terms. CONCLUSIONS: MeSHOPs allows
      quantitative measurement of the degree of association between any entity and the 
      annotated medical concepts, based directly on relevant primary literature.
      Comparison of MeSHOPs allows entities to be related based on shared medical
      themes in their literature. A web interface is provided for generating and
      visualizing MeSHOPs.

TI  - Improving image retrieval effectiveness via query expansion using MeSH
      hierarchical structure.
PG  - 1014-20
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000943 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We explored two strategies for query expansion utilizing medical
      subject headings (MeSH) ontology to improve the effectiveness of medical image
      retrieval systems. In order to achieve greater effectiveness in the expansion,
      the search text was analyzed to identify which terms were most amenable to being 
      expanded. DESIGN: To perform the expansions we utilized the hierarchical
      structure by which the MeSH descriptors are organized. Two strategies for
      selecting the terms to be expanded in each query were studied. The first
      consisted of identifying the medical concepts using the unified medical language 
      system metathesaurus. In the second strategy the text of the query was divided
      into n-grams, resulting in sequences corresponding to MeSH descriptors.
      MEASUREMENTS: For the evaluation of the system, we used the collection made
      available by the ImageCLEF organization in its 2011 medical image retrieval task.
      The main measure of efficiency employed for evaluating the techniques developed
      was the mean average precision (MAP). RESULTS: Both strategies exceeded the
      average MAP score in the ImageCLEF 2011 competition (0.1644). The n-gram
      expansion strategy achieved a MAP of 0.2004, which represents an improvement of
      21.89% over the average MAP score in the competition. On the other hand, the
      medical concepts expansion strategy scored 0.2172 in the MAP, representing a
      32.11% improvement. This run won the text-based medical image retrieval task in
      2011. CONCLUSIONS: Query expansion exploiting the hierarchical structure of the
      MeSH descriptors achieved a significant improvement in image retrieval systems.

TI  - Improving information retrieval using Medical Subject Headings Concepts: a test
      case on rare and chronic diseases.
PG  - 176-83
LID - 10.3163/1536-5050.100.3.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As more scientific work is published, it is important to improve
      access to the biomedical literature. Since 2000, when Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSH) Concepts were introduced, the MeSH Thesaurus has been concept based.
      Nevertheless, information retrieval is still performed at the MeSH Descriptor or 
      Supplementary Concept level. OBJECTIVE: The study assesses the benefit of using
      MeSH Concepts for indexing and information retrieval. METHODS: Three sets of
      queries were built for thirty-two rare diseases and twenty-two chronic diseases: 
      (1) using PubMed Automatic Term Mapping (ATM), (2) using Catalog and Index of
      French-language Health Internet (CISMeF) ATM, and (3) extrapolating the MEDLINE
      citations that should be indexed with a MeSH Concept. RESULTS: Type 3 queries
      retrieve significantly fewer results than type 1 or type 2 queries (about 18,000 
      citations versus 200,000 for rare diseases; about 300,000 citations versus
      2,000,000 for chronic diseases). CISMeF ATM also provides better precision than
      PubMed ATM for both disease categories. DISCUSSION: Using MeSH Concept indexing
      instead of ATM is theoretically possible to improve retrieval performance with
      the current indexing policy. However, using MeSH Concept information retrieval
      and indexing rules would be a fundamentally better approach. These modifications 
      have already been implemented in the CISMeF search engine.

      concern exists over the quality, accuracy, and readability of the information.

      information online about distal radius fractures vary with the search term.
      METHODS: This was a prospective evaluation of 3 search engines using 3 different 
      search terms of varying sophistication ("distal radius fracture," "wrist
      fracture," and "broken wrist"). We evaluated 70 unique Web sites for quality,
      accuracy, and readability. We used comparative statistics to determine whether
      the search term affected the quality, accuracy, and readability of the Web sites 
      found. Three orthopedic surgeons independently gauged quality and accuracy of
      information using a set of predetermined scoring criteria. We evaluated the
      readability of the Web site using the Fleisch-Kincaid score for reading grade
      level. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the quality, accuracy, and 
      readability of information found, depending on the search term. We found higher
      quality and accuracy resulted from the search term "distal radius fracture,"
      particularly compared with Web sites resulting from the term "broken wrist." The 
      reading level was higher than recommended in 65 of the 70 Web sites and was
      significantly higher when searching with "distal radius fracture" than "wrist
      fracture" or "broken wrist." There was no correlation between Web site reading
      level and quality or accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The readability of information about 
      distal radius fractures in most Web sites was higher than the recommended reading
      level for the general public. The quality and accuracy of the information found
      significantly varied with the sophistication of the search term used. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: Physicians, professional societies, and search engines should consider
      efforts to improve internet access to high-quality information at an
      understandable level.

TI  - Extending ontologies by finding siblings using set expansion techniques.
PG  - i292-300
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts215 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Ontologies are an everyday tool in biomedicine to capture and
      represent knowledge. However, many ontologies lack a high degree of coverage in
      their domain and need to improve their overall quality and maturity.
      Automatically extending sets of existing terms will enable ontology engineers to 
      systematically improve text-based ontologies level by level. RESULTS: We
      developed an approach to extend ontologies by discovering new terms which are in 
      a sibling relationship to existing terms of an ontology. For this purpose, we
      combined two approaches which retrieve new terms from the web. The first approach
      extracts siblings by exploiting the structure of HTML documents, whereas the
      second approach uses text mining techniques to extract siblings from unstructured
      text. Our evaluation against MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) shows that our
      method for sibling discovery is able to suggest first-class ontology terms and
      can be used as an initial step towards assessing the completeness of ontologies. 
      The evaluation yields a recall of 80% at a precision of 61% where the two
      independent approaches are complementing each other. For MeSH in particular, we
      show that it can be considered complete in its medical focus area. We integrated 
      the work into DOG4DAG, an ontology generation plugin for the editors OBO-Edit and
      Protege, making it the first plugin that supports sibling discovery on-the-fly.
      AVAILABILITY: Sibling discovery for ontology is available as part of DOG4DAG
      (www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/research/schroeder/dog4dag) for both Protege 4.1 and
      OBO-Edit 2.1.

TI  - Evaluation of the testicular toxicity of prenatal exposure to bisphenol A based
      on microarray analysis combined with MeSH annotation.
PG  - 539-48
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is known to be an endocrine disruptor that affects the
      development of reproductive system. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate a group of testicular genes dysregulated by prenatal exposure to BPA.
      Pregnant ICR mice were treated with BPA by subcutaneous administration on days 7 
      and 14 of pregnancy. Tissue and blood samples were collected from 6-week-old male
      offspring. Testes were subjected to gene expression analysis using a
      testis-specific microarray (Testis2), consisting of 2,482 mouse cDNA clones
      annotated with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms indicative of testicular
      components and functions. To interpret the microarray data, we used the MeSH
      terms significantly associated with the altered genes. As a result, MeSH terms
      related to androgens and Sertoli cells were extracted in BPA-treated groups.
      Among the genes related to Sertoli cells, downregulation of Msi1h, Ncoa1, Nid1,
      Hspb2, and Gata6 were detected in the testis of mice treated with BPA (twice
      administered 50 mg/kg). The MeSH terms associated with this group of genes may
      provide useful means to interpret the testicular toxicity of BPA. This article
      concludes that prenatal BPA exposure downregulates expression of genes associated
      with Sertoli cell function and affects the reproductive function of male
      offspring. Additionally, a method using MeSH to extract a group of genes was
      useful for predicting the testicular and reproductive toxicity of prenatal BPA
      exposure.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the key words used in Acta Cirurgica Brasileira from 1997 to
      2012. METHODS: All the key words of all articles published in regular issues
      between 1997 and 2012 were analyzed, ensuring that these key words were in the
      MeSH database (Medical Subjects Headings) and the most used subject headings and 
      most wrong repeated key words were ranked. RESULTS: > 4230 key words used in 990 
      articles were analyzed. Only 579 key words (13.68%) were not in the MeSH
      database, considering that there was a statistically significant decrease over
      the years (p<0.001). The three most used key words were Rats, Dogs and Wound
      healing. Among the wrong ones, the key words were Adhesions, Experimental surgery
      and Anatomosis. CONCLUSION: There was a gradual improvement in the amount of key 
      words used that belonged to the MeSH database, and there were 618 articles
      (62.42%) with all key words correct.

PG  - 1408-10
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts156 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Progress in high-throughput genomic technologies has led to the
      development of a variety of resources that link genes to functional information
      contained in the biomedical literature. However, tools attempting to link small
      molecules to normal and diseased physiology and published data relevant to
      biologists and clinical investigators, are still lacking. With metabolomics
      rapidly emerging as a new omics field, the task of annotating small molecule
      metabolites becomes highly relevant. Our tool Metab2MeSH uses a statistical
      approach to reliably and automatically annotate compounds with concepts defined
      in Medical Subject Headings, and the National Library of Medicine's controlled
      vocabulary for biomedical concepts. These annotations provide links from
      compounds to biomedical literature and complement existing resources such as
      PubChem and the Human Metabolome Database.

TI  - Leveraging medical thesauri and physician feedback for improving medical
      literature retrieval for case queries.
PG  - 851-8
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000293 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a study of methods for medical literature
      retrieval for case queries, in which the goal is to retrieve literature articles 
      similar to a given patient case. In particular, it focuses on analyzing the
      performance of state-of-the-art general retrieval methods and improving them by
      the use of medical thesauri and physician feedback. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      Kullback-Leibler divergence retrieval model with Dirichlet smoothing is used as
      the state-of-the-art general retrieval method. Pseudorelevance feedback and term 
      weighing methods are proposed by leveraging MeSH and UMLS thesauri. Evaluation is
      performed on a test collection recently created for the ImageCLEF medical case
      retrieval challenge. RESULTS: Experimental results show that a well-tuned
      state-of-the-art general retrieval model achieves a mean average precision of
      0.2754, but the performance can be improved by over 40% to 0.3980, through the
      proposed methods. DISCUSSION: The results over the ImageCLEF test collection,
      which is currently the best collection available for the task, are encouraging.
      There are, however, limitations due to small evaluation set size. The analysis
      shows that further refinement of the methods is necessary before they can be
      really useful in a clinical setting. CONCLUSION: Medical case-based literature
      retrieval is a critical search application that presents a number of unique
      challenges. This analysis shows that the state-of-the-art general retrieval
      models are reasonably good for the task, but the performance can be significantly
      improved by developing new task-specific retrieval models that incorporate
      medical thesauri and physician feedback.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Advances from health research are not well applied giving rise to
      over- and underuse of resources and inferior care. Knowledge translation (KT),
      actions and processes of getting research findings used in practice, can improve 
      research application. The KT literature is difficult to find because of
      nonstandardized terminology, rapid evolution of the field, and it is spread
      across several domains. We created multiple search filters to retrieve KT
      articles from MEDLINE. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Analytic survey using articles
      from 12 journals tagged as having KT content and also as describing a KT
      application or containing a KT theory. RESULTS: Of 2,594 articles, 579 were KT
      articles of which 201 were about KT applications and 152 about KT theory. Search 
      filter sensitivity (retrieval efficiency) maximized at 83%-94% with specificity
      (no retrieval of irrelevant material) approximately 50%. Filter performances were
      enhanced with multiple terms, but these filters often had reduced specificity.
      Performance was higher for KT applications and KT theory articles. These filters 
      can select KT material although many irrelevant articles also will be retrieved. 
      CONCLUSION: KT search filters were developed and tested, with good sensitivity
      but suboptimal specificity. Further research must improve their performance.

TI  - Performance evaluation of Unified Medical Language System(R)'s synonyms expansion
      to query PubMed.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-12-12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PubMed is the main access to medical literature on the Internet. In
      order to enhance the performance of its information retrieval tools, primarily
      non-indexed citations, the authors propose a method: expanding users' queries
      using Unified Medical Language System' (UMLS) synonyms i.e. all the terms
      gathered under one unique Concept Unique Identifier. METHODS: This method was
      evaluated using queries constructed to emphasize the differences between this new
      method and the current PubMed automatic term mapping. Four experts assessed
      citation relevance. RESULTS: Using UMLS, we were able to retrieve new citations
      in 45.5% of queries, which implies a small increase in recall. The new strategy
      led to a heterogeneous 23.7% mean increase in non-indexed citation retrieved. Of 
      these, 82% have been published less than 4 months earlier. The overall mean
      precision was 48.4% but differed according to the evaluators, ranging from 36.7% 
      to 88.1% (Inter rater agreement was poor: kappa = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      highlights the need for specific search tools for each type of user and
      use-cases. The proposed strategy may be useful to retrieve recent scientific
      advancement.

TI  - Sensitivity and precision of adverse effects search filters in MEDLINE and

PG  - 28-38

AB  - BACKGROUND: Search filters have been developed in MEDLINE and EMBASE to help
      overcome the challenges of searching electronic databases for information on
      adverse effects. However, little evaluation of their effectiveness has been
      carried out. OBJECTIVES: To measure the sensitivity and precision of available
      adverse effects search filters in MEDLINE and EMBASE. METHODS: A case study
      systematic review of fracture related adverse effects associated with the use of 
      thiazolidinediones was used. Twelve MEDLINE search strategies and three EMBASE
      search strategies were tested. RESULTS: Nineteen relevant references from MEDLINE
      and 24 from EMBASE were included in the review. Four search filters in MEDLINE
      achieved high sensitivity (95 or 100%) with an improved level of precision from
      searches without any adverse effects filter. High precision in MEDLINE could also
      be achieved (up to 53%) using search filters that rely on Medical Subject
      Headings. No search filter in EMBASE achieved high precision (all were under 5%) 
      and the highest sensitivity in EMBASE was 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects
      search filters appear to be effective in MEDLINE for achieving either high
      sensitivity or high precision. Search filters in EMBASE, however, do not appear
      as effective, particularly in improving precision.

TI  - A bottom-up approach to MEDLINE indexing recommendations.
PG  - 1583-92
AB  - MEDLINE indexing performed by the US National Library of Medicine staff describes
      the essence of a biomedical publication in about 14 Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSH). Since 2002, this task is assisted by the Medical Text Indexer (MTI)
      program. We present a bottom-up approach to MEDLINE indexing in which the
      abstract is searched for indicators for a specific MeSH recommendation in a
      two-step process. Supervised machine learning combined with triage rules improves
      sensitivity of recommendations while keeping the number of recommended terms
      relatively small. Improvement in recommendations observed in this work warrants
      further exploration of this approach to MTI recommendations on a larger set of
      MeSH headings.

TI  - Using MeSH (medical subject headings) to enhance PubMed search strategies for
      evidence-based practice in physical therapy.
PG  - 124-32
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20100178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an important paradigm in health
      care. Physical therapists report lack of knowledge and time constraints as
      barriers to EBP. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this technical report is to illustrate
      how Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), a controlled vocabulary thesaurus of
      indexing terms, is used to efficiently search MEDLINE, the largest component of
      PubMed. Using clinical questions, this report illustrates how search terms common
      to physical therapist practice do or do not map to appropriate MeSH terms. A
      PubMed search strategy that takes advantage of text words and MeSH terms is
      provided. RESULTS: A search of 139 terms and 13 acronyms was conducted to
      determine whether they appropriately mapped to a MeSH term. The search results
      were categorized into 1 of 5 outcomes. Nearly half (66/139) of the search terms
      mapped to an appropriate MeSH term (outcome 1). When a search term did not
      appropriately map to a MeSH term, it was entered into the MeSH database to search
      for an appropriate MeSH term. Twenty-one appropriate MeSH terms were found
      (outcomes 2 and 4), and there were 52 search terms for which an appropriate MeSH 
      term was not found (outcomes 3 and 5). Nearly half of the acronyms did not map to
      an appropriate MeSH term, and an appropriate MeSH term was not found in the
      database. LIMITATIONS: The results are based on a limited number of search terms 
      and acronyms. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how search terms map to MeSH terms and
      using the PubMed search strategy can enable physical therapists to take full
      advantage of available MeSH terms and should result in more-efficient and
      better-informed searches.

TI  - Exploiting domain information for Word Sense Disambiguation of medical documents.
PG  - 235-40
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000415 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current techniques for knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
      of ambiguous biomedical terms rely on relations in the Unified Medical Language
      System Metathesaurus but do not take into account the domain of the target
      documents. The authors' goal is to improve these methods by using information
      about the topic of the document in which the ambiguous term appears. DESIGN: The 
      authors proposed and implemented several methods to extract lists of key terms
      associated with Medical Subject Heading terms. These key terms are used to
      represent the document topic in a knowledge-based WSD system. They are applied
      both alone and in combination with local context. MEASUREMENTS: A standard
      measure of accuracy was calculated over the set of target words in the widely
      used National Library of Medicine WSD dataset. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The
      authors report a significant improvement when combining those key terms with
      local context, showing that domain information improves the results of a WSD
      system based on the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus alone. The best
      results were obtained using key terms obtained by relevance feedback and weighted
      by inverse document frequency.

TI  - MeSH: a window into full text for document summarization.
PG  - i120-8
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr223 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Previous research in the biomedical text-mining domain has
      historically been limited to titles, abstracts and metadata available in MEDLINE 
      records. Recent research initiatives such as TREC Genomics and BioCreAtIvE
      strongly point to the merits of moving beyond abstracts and into the realm of
      full texts. Full texts are, however, more expensive to process not only in terms 
      of resources needed but also in terms of accuracy. Since full texts contain
      embellishments that elaborate, contextualize, contrast, supplement, etc., there
      is greater risk for false positives. Motivated by this, we explore an approach
      that offers a compromise between the extremes of abstracts and full texts.
      Specifically, we create reduced versions of full text documents that contain only
      important portions. In the long-term, our goal is to explore the use of such
      summaries for functions such as document retrieval and information extraction.
      Here, we focus on designing summarization strategies. In particular, we explore
      the use of MeSH terms, manually assigned to documents by trained annotators, as
      clues to select important text segments from the full text documents. RESULTS:
      Our experiments confirm the ability of our approach to pick the important text
      portions. Using the ROUGE measures for evaluation, we were able to achieve
      maximum ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 F-scores of 0.4150, 0.1435 and 0.1782,
      respectively, for our MeSH term-based method versus the maximum baseline scores
      of 0.3815, 0.1353 and 0.1428, respectively. Using a MeSH profile-based strategy, 
      we were able to achieve maximum ROUGE F-scores of 0.4320, 0.1497 and 0.1887,
      respectively. Human evaluation of the baselines and our proposed strategies
      further corroborates the ability of our method to select important sentences from
      the full texts. CONTACT: sanmitra-bhattacharya@uiowa.edu;

TI  - MeSHy: Mining unanticipated PubMed information using frequencies of occurrences
      and concurrences of MeSH terms.
PG  - 919-26
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2011.05.009 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: PubMed is the most widely used database of biomedical literature. To 
      the detriment of the user though, the ranking of the documents retrieved for a
      query is not content-based, and important semantic information in the form of
      assigned Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms is not readily presented or
      productively utilized. The motivation behind this work was the discovery of
      unanticipated information through the appropriate ranking of MeSH term pairs and,
      indirectly, documents. Such information can be useful in guiding novel research
      and following promising trends. METHODS: A web-based tool, called MeSHy, was
      developed implementing a mainly statistical algorithm. The algorithm takes into
      account the frequencies of occurrences, concurrences, and the semantic
      similarities of MeSH terms in retrieved PubMed documents to create MeSH term
      pairs. These are then scored and ranked, focusing on their unexpectedly frequent 
      or infrequent occurrences. RESULTS: MeSHy presents results through an online
      interactive interface facilitating further manipulation through filtering and
      sorting. The results themselves include the MeSH term pairs, along with MeSH
      categories, the score, and document IDs, all of which are hyperlinked for
      convenience. To highlight the applicability of the tool, we report the findings
      of an expert in the pharmacology field on querying the molecularly-targeted drug 
      imatinib and nutrition-related flavonoids. To the best of our knowledge, MeSHy is
      the first publicly available tool able to directly provide such a different
      perspective on the complex nature of published work. IMPLEMENTATION AND
      AVAILABILITY: Implemented in Perl and served by Apache2 at
      http://bat.ina.certh.gr/tools/meshy/ with all major browsers supported.

TI  - Improving MeSH classification of biomedical articles using citation contexts.
PG  - 881-96
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2011.05.007 [doi]
AB  - Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are used to index the majority of databases
      generated by the National Library of Medicine. Essentially, MeSH terms are
      designed to make information, such as scientific articles, more retrievable and
      assessable to users of systems such as PubMed. This paper proposes a novel method
      for automating the assignment of biomedical publications with MeSH terms that
      takes advantage of citation references to these publications. Our findings show
      that analysing the citation references that point to a document can provide a
      useful source of terms that are not present in the document. The use of these
      citation contexts, as they are known, can thus help to provide a richer document 
      feature representation, which in turn can help improve text mining and
      information retrieval applications, in our case MeSH term classification. In this
      paper, we also explore new methods of selecting and utilising citation contexts. 
      In particular, we assess the effect of weighting the importance of citation terms
      (found in the citation contexts) according to two aspects: (i) the section of the
      paper they appear in and (ii) their distance to the citation marker. We conduct
      intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of citation term quality. For the intrinsic
      evaluation, we rely on the UMLS Metathesaurus conceptual database to explore the 
      semantic characteristics of the mined citation terms. We also analyse the
      "informativeness" of these terms using a class-entropy measure. For the extrinsic
      evaluation, we run a series of automatic document classification experiments over
      MeSH terms. Our experimental evaluation shows that citation contexts contain
      terms that are related to the original document, and that the integration of this
      knowledge results in better classification performance compared to two
      state-of-the-art MeSH classification systems: MeSHUP and MTI. Our experiments
      also demonstrate that the consideration of Section and Distance factors can lead 
      to statistically significant improvements in citation feature quality, thus
      opening the way for better document feature representation in other biomedical
      text processing applications.

TI  - Exploiting MeSH indexing in MEDLINE to generate a data set for word sense
      disambiguation.
PG  - 223
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods in the
      biomedical domain is difficult because the available resources are either too
      small or too focused on specific types of entities (e.g. diseases or genes). We
      present a method that can be used to automatically develop a WSD test collection 
      using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and the manual
      MeSH indexing of MEDLINE. We demonstrate the use of this method by developing
      such a data set, called MSH WSD. METHODS: In our method, the Metathesaurus is
      first screened to identify ambiguous terms whose possible senses consist of two
      or more MeSH headings. We then use each ambiguous term and its corresponding MeSH
      heading to extract MEDLINE citations where the term and only one of the MeSH
      headings co-occur. The term found in the MEDLINE citation is automatically
      assigned the UMLS CUI linked to the MeSH heading. Each instance has been assigned
      a UMLS Concept Unique Identifier (CUI). We compare the characteristics of the MSH
      WSD data set to the previously existing NLM WSD data set. RESULTS: The resulting 
      MSH WSD data set consists of 106 ambiguous abbreviations, 88 ambiguous terms and 
      9 which are a combination of both, for a total of 203 ambiguous entities. For
      each ambiguous term/abbreviation, the data set contains a maximum of 100
      instances per sense obtained from MEDLINE.We evaluated the reliability of the MSH
      WSD data set using existing knowledge-based methods and compared their
      performance to that of the results previously obtained by these algorithms on the
      pre-existing data set, NLM WSD. We show that the knowledge-based methods achieve 
      different results but keep their relative performance except for the Journal
      Descriptor Indexing (JDI) method, whose performance is below the other methods.
      CONCLUSIONS: The MSH WSD data set allows the evaluation of WSD algorithms in the 
      biomedical domain. Compared to previously existing data sets, MSH WSD contains a 
      larger number of biomedical terms/abbreviations and covers the largest set of
      UMLS Semantic Types. Furthermore, the MSH WSD data set has been generated
      automatically reusing already existing annotations and, therefore, can be
      regenerated from subsequent UMLS versions.

LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2010-000055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the high cost of manual curation of key aspects from the
      scientific literature, automated methods for assisting this process are greatly
      desired. Here, we report a novel approach to facilitate MeSH indexing, a
      challenging task of assigning MeSH terms to MEDLINE citations for their archiving
      and retrieval. METHODS: Unlike previous methods for automatic MeSH term
      assignment, we reformulate the indexing task as a ranking problem such that
      relevant MeSH headings are ranked higher than those irrelevant ones.
      Specifically, for each document we retrieve 20 neighbor documents, obtain a list 
      of MeSH main headings from neighbors, and rank the MeSH main headings using
      ListNet-a learning-to-rank algorithm. We trained our algorithm on 200 documents
      and tested on a previously used benchmark set of 200 documents and a larger
      dataset of 1000 documents. RESULTS: Tested on the benchmark dataset, our method
      achieved a precision of 0.390, recall of 0.712, and mean average precision (MAP) 
      of 0.626. In comparison to the state of the art, we observe statistically
      significant improvements as large as 39% in MAP (p-value <0.001). Similar
      significant improvements were also obtained on the larger document set.
      CONCLUSION: Experimental results show that our approach makes the most accurate
      MeSH predictions to date, which suggests its great potential in making a
      practical impact on MeSH indexing. Furthermore, as discussed the proposed
      learning framework is robust and can be adapted to many other similar tasks
      beyond MeSH indexing in the biomedical domain. All data sets are available at:

LID - S0102-86502011000300014 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the relevance of the term superficial musculoaponeurotic 
      system (SMAS) and demonstrate that this term is important enough to be added to
      the MeSH database and listed in International Anatomical Nomenclature. METHODS:
      Terms related to SMAS were selected from original articles retrieved from the ISI
      Web of Science and MEDLINE (PubMed) databases. Groups of terms were created to
      define a search strategy with high-sensitivity and restricted to scientific
      periodicals devoted to plastic surgery. This study included articles between
      January 1996 and May 2009, whose titles, abstracts, and keywords were searched
      for SMAS-related terms and all occurrences were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 126
      original articles were retrieved from the main periodicals related to plastic
      surgery in the referred databases. Of these articles, 51.6% had SMAS-related
      terms in the abstract only, and 25.4% had SMAS-related terms in both the title
      and abstract. The term 'superficial musculoaponeurotic system' was present as a
      keyword in 19.8% of the articles. The most frequent terms were 'SMAS' (71.4%) and
      superficial musculoaponeurotic system (62.7%). CONCLUSION: The term SMAS refers
      to a structure relevant enough to start a discussion about indexing it as a
      keyword and as an official term in Terminologia Anatomica: International
      Anatomical Terminology.

TI  - MEDRank: using graph-based concept ranking to index biomedical texts.
PG  - 431-41
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.02.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the volume of biomedical text increases exponentially, automatic
      indexing becomes increasingly important. However, existing approaches do not
      distinguish central (or core) concepts from concepts that were mentioned in
      passing. We focus on the problem of indexing MEDLINE records, a process that is
      currently performed by highly trained humans at the National Library of Medicine 
      (NLM). NLM indexers are assisted by a system called the Medical Text Indexer
      (MTI) that suggests candidate indexing terms. OBJECTIVE: To improve the ability
      of MTI to select the core terms in MEDLINE abstracts. These core concepts are
      deemed to be most important and are designated as "major headings" by MEDLINE
      indexers. We introduce and evaluate a graph-based indexing methodology called
      MEDRank that generates concept graphs from biomedical text and then ranks the
      concepts within these graphs to identify the most important ones. METHODS: We
      insert a MEDRank step into the MTI and compare MTI's output with and without
      MEDRank to the MEDLINE indexers' selected terms for a sample of 11,803 PubMed
      Central articles. We also tested whether human raters prefer terms generated by
      the MEDLINE indexers, MTI without MEDRank, and MTI with MEDRank for a sample of
      36 PubMed Central articles. RESULTS: MEDRank improved recall of major headings
      designated by 30% over MTI without MEDRank (0.489 vs. 0.376). Overall recall was 
      only slightly (6.5%) higher (0.490 vs. 0.460) as was F(2) (3%, 0.408 vs. 0.396). 
      However, overall precision was 3.9% lower (0.268 vs. 0.279). Human raters
      preferred terms generated by MTI with MEDRank over terms generated by MTI without
      MEDRank (by an average of 1.00 more term per article), and preferred terms
      generated by MTI with MEDRank and the MEDLINE indexers at the same rate.
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of MEDRank to MTI significantly improved the retrieval 
      of core concepts in MEDLINE abstracts and more closely matched human expectations
      compared to MTI without MEDRank. In addition, MEDRank slightly improved overall
      recall and F(2).

AB  - Publicly available molecular datasets can be used for independent verification or
      investigative repurposing, but depends on the presence, consistency and quality
      of descriptive annotations. Annotation and indexing of molecular datasets using
      well-defined controlled vocabularies or ontologies enables accurate and
      systematic data discovery, yet the majority of molecular datasets available
      through public data repositories lack such annotations. A number of automated
      annotation methods have been developed; however few systematic evaluations of the
      quality of annotations supplied by application of these methods have been
      performed using annotations from standing public data repositories. Here, we
      compared manually-assigned Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) annotations associated 
      with experiments by data submitters in the PRoteomics IDEntification (PRIDE)
      proteomics data repository to automated MeSH annotations derived through the
      National Center for Biomedical Ontology Annotator and National Library of
      Medicine MetaMap programs. These programs were applied to free-text annotations
      for experiments in PRIDE. As many submitted datasets were referenced in
      publications, we used the manually curated MeSH annotations of those linked
      publications in MEDLINE as "gold standard". Annotator and MetaMap exhibited
      recall performance 3-fold greater than that of the manual annotations. We
      connected PRIDE experiments in a network topology according to shared MeSH
      annotations and found 373 distinct clusters, many of which were found to be
      biologically coherent by network analysis. The results of this study suggest that
      both Annotator and MetaMap are capable of annotating public molecular datasets
      with a quality comparable, and often exceeding, that of the actual data
      submitters, highlighting a continuous need to improve and apply automated methods
      to molecular datasets in public data repositories to maximize their value and
      utility.

TI  - [Virtual room of gastroenterology].
PG  - 367-72
AB  - The amount of published information and its continuing growth can no longer be
      managed by an individual searcher. One of today's great challenges for the
      academic researcher and clinician is to find a relevant scientific article using 
      bibliographic search strategies. We aimed to design and build a Virtual Room of
      Gastroenterology (VRG) generating real-time automated search strategies and
      producing bibliographic and full text search results. These results update and
      complement with the latest evidence the Clinical Guideline Program of the World
      Gastroenterology Organisation. The HTML driven interface provides a series of
      pre-formulated MeSH based search strategies for each Aula. For each topic between
      10 and 20 specific terms, qualifiers and subheadings are identified. The
      functionality of the VRG is based on the PubMed's characteristic that allows a
      search strategy to be captured as a web address. The VRG is available in Spanish 
      and English, and the access is free. There are 28 rooms currently available. All 
      together these rooms provide an advanced bibliographic access using more than 900
      pre-programmed MeSH driven strategies. In a further very recent development some 
      of the topics of VRG now allow cascade based searches. These searches look at
      resource sensitive options and possible ethnic difference per topic. The VRG
      allows significant reductions in time required to design and carry out complex
      bibliographic searches in the areas of gastroenterology, hepatology and
      endoscopy. The system updates automatically in real-time thus ensuring the
      currency of the results.

TI  - Author keywords in biomedical journal articles.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - As an information retrieval system, PubMed((R)) aims at providing efficient
      access to documents cited in MEDLINE((R)). For this purpose, it relies on
      matching representations of documents, as provided by authors and indexers to
      user queries. In this paper, we describe the growth of author keywords in
      biomedical journal articles and present a comparative study of author keywords
      and MeSH((R)) indexing terms assigned by MEDLINE indexers to PubMed Central Open 
      Access articles. A similarity metric is used to assess automatically the
      relatedness between pairs of author keywords and indexing terms. A set of 300
      pairs is manually reviewed to evaluate the metric and characterize the
      relationships between author keywords and indexing terms. Results show that
      author keywords are increasingly available in biomedical articles and that over
      60% of author keywords can be linked to a closely related indexing term. Finally,
      we discuss the potential impact of this work on indexing and terminology
      development.

TI  - MeSH term explosion and author rank improve expert recommendations.
PG  - 412-6
AB  - Information overload is an often-cited phenomenon that reduces the productivity, 
      efficiency and efficacy of scientists. One challenge for scientists is to find
      appropriate collaborators in their research. The literature describes various
      solutions to the problem of expertise location, but most current approaches do
      not appear to be very suitable for expert recommendations in biomedical research.
      In this study, we present the development and initial evaluation of a vector
      space model-based algorithm to calculate researcher similarity using four inputs:
      1) MeSH terms of publications; 2) MeSH terms and author rank; 3) exploded MeSH
      terms; and 4) exploded MeSH terms and author rank. We developed and evaluated the
      algorithm using a data set of 17,525 authors and their 22,542 papers. On average,
      our algorithms correctly predicted 2.5 of the top 5/10 coauthors of individual
      scientists. Exploded MeSH and author rank outperformed all other algorithms in
      accuracy, followed closely by MeSH and author rank. Our results show that the
      accuracy of MeSH term-based matching can be enhanced with other metadata such as 
      author rank.

TI  - Health sciences descriptors in the brazilian speech-language and hearing science.
PG  - 397-402
LID - S0104-56872010000400006 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminology in Speech-Language and Hearing Science. AIM: To propose a
      specific thesaurus about the Speech-Language and Hearing Science, for the
      English, Portuguese and Spanish languages, based on the existing keywords
      available on the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS). METHOD: Methodology was
      based on the pilot study developed by Campanatti-Ostiz and Andrade; that had as a
      purpose to verify the methodological viability for the creation of a
      Speech-Language and Hearing Science category in the DeCS. The scientific journals
      selected for analyses of the titles, abstracts and keywords of all scientific
      articles were those in the field of the Speech-Language and Hearing Science,
      indexed on the SciELO. 1. Recovery of the Descriptors in the English language
      (Medical Subject Headings--MeSH); 2. Recovery and hierarchic organization of the 
      descriptors in the Portuguese language was done (DeCS). The obtained data was
      analyzed as follows: descriptive analyses and relative relevance analyses of the 
      DeCS areas. Based on the first analyses, we decided to select all 761
      descriptors, with all the hierarchic numbers, independently of their occurrence
      (occurrence number--ON), and based on the second analyses, we decided to propose 
      to exclude the less relevant areas and the exclusive DeCS areas. RESULTS: The
      proposal was finished with a total of 1676 occurrences of DeCS descriptors,
      distributed in the following areas: Anatomy; Diseases; Analytical, Diagnostic and
      Therapeutic Techniques and Equipments; Psychiatry and Psychology; Phenomena and
      Processes; Health Care. CONCLUSION: The presented proposal of a thesaurus
      contains the specific terminology of the Brazilian Speech-Language and Hearing
      Sciences and reflects the descriptors of the published scientific production.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the usefulness of the controlled vocabularies of
      PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO for finding articles on injury prevention and safety 
      promotion (IPSP) topics and to identify specific indexing problems that can
      contribute to incomplete retrieval. METHODS: Professional reference librarians
      provided search strategies for finding articles relevant to five topics
      pertaining to the injury prevention field in the two bibliographic databases. The
      results of implementing these search strategies were compared with the results of
      a presumptive gold standard-serial textword searches on the same topics. The
      index terms assigned to the articles that were missed by the librarian strategies
      were examined. RESULTS: The search products of the librarian-constructed search
      strategies identified 34-91% of the IPSP-relevant articles that were identified
      through serial textword searches of the two databases. Specific indexing issues
      were found to contribute to this loss. CONCLUSIONS: Librarians bring expertise to
      searching, but irregular or incomplete indexing can limit the product of even
      well-constructed searches for articles on IPSP topics.

TI  - Use of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) in Portuguese for categorizing web-based
      healthcare content.
PG  - 299-309
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2010.12.002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Internet users are increasingly using the worldwide web to search
      for information relating to their health. This situation makes it necessary to
      create specialized tools capable of supporting users in their searches.
      OBJECTIVE: To apply and compare strategies that were developed to investigate the
      use of the Portuguese version of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for constructing
      an automated classifier for Brazilian Portuguese-language web-based content
      within or outside of the field of healthcare, focusing on the lay public.
      METHODS: 3658 Brazilian web pages were used to train the classifier and 606
      Brazilian web pages were used to validate it. The strategies proposed were
      constructed using content-based vector methods for text classification, such that
      Naive Bayes was used for the task of classifying vector patterns with
      characteristics obtained through the proposed strategies. RESULTS: A strategy
      named InDeCS was developed specifically to adapt MeSH for the problem that was
      put forward. This approach achieved better accuracy for this pattern
      classification task (0.94 sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve).
      CONCLUSIONS: Because of the significant results achieved by InDeCS, this tool has
      been successfully applied to the Brazilian healthcare search portal known as
      Busca Saude. Furthermore, it could be shown that MeSH presents important results 
      when used for the task of classifying web-based content focusing on the lay
      public. It was also possible to show from this study that MeSH was able to map
      out mutable non-deterministic characteristics of the web.

PG  - 737-44

AB  - Both patents and Medline are important document collections for discovering new
      relationships between chemicals and biology, searching for prior art for patent
      applications and retrieving background knowledge for current research activities.
      Finding relevance to a topic within patents is often made difficult by poor
      categorization, badly written descriptions, and even intentional obfuscation.
      Unlike patents, the Medline corpus has Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords
      manually added to their articles, giving a medically relevant taxonomy to the 18 
      million article abstracts. Our work attempts to accurately recognize the
      citations made in patents to Medline-indexed articles, linking them to their
      corresponding PubMed ID and exploiting the associated MeSH to enhance patent
      search by annotating the referencing patents with their Medline citations' MeSH
      codes. The techniques, system features, and benefits are explained.

TI  - Aligning UniProt and MeSH - a case study on human protein terms.
PG  - 1030-4
AB  - Terminologies which lack semantic connectivity hamper the effective search in
      biomedical fact databases and document retrieval systems. We here focus on the
      integration of two such isolated resources, the term lists from the protein fact 
      database UNIPROT and the indexing vocabulary MESH from the bibliographic database
      MEDLINE. The generated semantic ties result from string matching and term set
      inclusion. We investigated the implicit terminological overlap between both
      resources in the domain of human proteins and evaluated our approach on a sample 
      of 550 randomly selected UNIPROT entries that were manually mapped to their
      corresponding MESH headings. We achieved 90% precision and 79% recall (applying
      taxonomy-sensitive metrics). Fortunately, those proteins we were able to map to
      the MESH are ten times as frequently discussed in the literature as those on
      which we failed.

TI  - Orthopaedic literature and MeSH.
PG  - 2621-6
LID - 10.1007/s11999-010-1387-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1916 there has been a recognized demand for a method of
      classification of orthopaedic literature inclusive enough to permit the proper
      collection and retrieval of all literature on the subject. Today, MEDLINE,
      available through the PubMed interface, has become the de facto standard for
      organization and retrieval of medical literature. The Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSH), used to provide indexing and assist in searching, are partly responsible 
      for this standard. Understanding how MeSH is built and maintained may lead the
      user to a better understanding of how to use MEDLINE, and what to expect from the
      indexing of an article. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this review is to
      provide an understanding of the organization of large quantities of indexed
      material, the indexing process and the considerations involved in developing an
      indexing vocabulary. WHERE ARE WE NOW?: Successful terminology development and
      use, a prerequisite for any sharing of information by electronic means, depends
      on both user (how the user is expected to use the system) and information (how
      the information is organized) models. MEDLINE has a simple user model and a
      simpler information model. The user is expected to determine what is relevant and
      which MeSH descriptors are appropriate. WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO?: While MEDLINE
      through PubMed is a success as viewed by the number of hits, further improvements
      will depend on better, faster indexing with a controlled terminology. Terminology
      development requires careful consideration of the nature of the subject, how
      users employ the terminology, the overall purpose of the terminology, and the
      framework of the systems in which it is used. HOW DO WE GET THERE?: For the
      future, understanding terminology development might enable the user to comprehend
      some of the issues involved in sharing of other information by electronic means. 
      Further improvements in the availability and accessibility of medical literature 
      will depend on continued maintenance and development of MeSH, as well as on
      refinement of the indexing process.

AB  - The NLM MeSH Thesaurus has been incorporated for use in the PORTAL-DOORS System
      (PDS) for resource metadata management on the semantic web. All 25588 descriptor 
      records from the NLM 2010 MeSH Thesaurus have been exposed as web accessible
      resources by the PDS MeSH2010 Thesaurus implemented as a PDS PORTAL Registry
      operating as a RESTful web service. Examples of records from the PDS MeSH2010
      PORTAL are demonstrated along with their use by records in other PDS PORTAL
      Registries that reference the concepts from the MeSH2010 Thesaurus. Use of this
      important biomedical terminology will greatly enhance the quality of metadata
      content of other PDS records thus improving cross-domain searches between
      different problem oriented domains and amongst different clinical specialty
      fields.

PG  - 686-93
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2010.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Improving the retrieval accuracy of MEDLINE documents is still a challenging
      issue due to low retrieval precision. Focusing on a query expansion technique
      based on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), this paper addresses the problem by
      systematically examining the effects of expansion term selection and adjustment
      of the term weights of the expanded query using a set of MEDLINE test documents
      called OHSUMED. Implementing a baseline information retrieval system based on the
      Okapi BM25 retrieval model, we compared six well-known term ranking algorithms
      for useful expansion term selection and then compared traditional term
      reweighting algorithms with our new variant of the standard Rocchio's feedback
      formula, which adopts a group-based weighting scheme. Our experimental results on
      the OHSUMED test collection showed a maximum improvement of 20.2% and 20.4% for
      mean average precision and recall measures over unexpanded queries when terms
      were expanded using a co-occurrence analysis-based term ranking algorithm in
      conjunction with our term reweighting algorithm (p-value<0.05). Our study shows
      the behaviors of different query reformulation techniques that can be utilized
      for more effective MEDLINE document retrieval.

TI  - GeneMesh: a web-based microarray analysis tool for relating differentially
      expressed genes to MeSH terms.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-11-166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An important objective of DNA microarray-based gene expression
      experimentation is determining inter-relationships that exist between
      differentially expressed genes and biological processes, molecular functions,
      cellular components, signaling pathways, physiologic processes and diseases.
      RESULTS: Here we describe GeneMesh, a web-based program that facilitates analysis
      of DNA microarray gene expression data. GeneMesh relates genes in a query set to 
      categories available in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchical index.
      The interface enables hypothesis driven relational analysis to a specific MeSH
      subcategory (e.g., Cardiovascular System, Genetic Processes, Immune System
      Diseases etc.) or unbiased relational analysis to broader MeSH categories (e.g., 
      Anatomy, Biological Sciences, Disease etc.). Genes found associated with a given 
      MeSH category are dynamically linked to facilitate tabular and graphical
      depiction of Entrez Gene information, Gene Ontology information, KEGG metabolic
      pathway diagrams and intermolecular interaction information. Expression intensity
      values of groups of genes that cluster in relation to a given MeSH category, gene
      ontology or pathway can be displayed as heat maps of Z score-normalized values.
      GeneMesh operates on gene expression data derived from a number of commercial
      microarray platforms including Affymetrix, Agilent and Illumina. CONCLUSIONS:
      GeneMesh is a versatile web-based tool for testing and developing new hypotheses 
      through relating genes in a query set (e.g., differentially expressed genes from 
      a DNA microarray experiment) to descriptors making up the hierarchical structure 
      of the National Library of Medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus, MeSH. The
      system further enhances the discovery process by providing links between sets of 
      genes associated with a given MeSH category to a rich set of html linked tabular 
      and graphic information including Entrez Gene summaries, gene ontologies,
      intermolecular interactions, overlays of genes onto KEGG pathway diagrams and
      heatmaps of expression intensity values. GeneMesh is freely available online at
      http://proteogenomics.musc.edu/genemesh/.

PG  - 442-50
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2009.10.003 [doi]
AB  - The centralized and public availability of molecular sequence and clinical trial 
      data presents an opportunity to identify potentially valuable linkages across the
      bench-to-bedside "T1" translational barrier. In this study, we sought to leverage
      keyword metadata (Medical Subject Heading [MeSH] descriptors) to infer
      relationships between molecular sequences and clinical trials, as indexed by
      GenBank and ClinicalTrials.gov. The results of this feasibility study found that 
      approximately 30% of sequences in GenBank could be linked to trials and over 90% 
      of trials in ClinicalTrials.gov could be linked to sequences through MeSH
      descriptors. In a cursory evaluation, we were able to consistently identify
      meaningful linkages between molecular sequences and clinical trials. Based on our
      findings, there may be promise in subsequent studies aiming to identify linkages 
      across the T1 translational barrier using existing large repositories.

LID - 10.1016/j.jchir.2009.08.025 [doi]
AB  - The foundation of evidence-based medicine is critical analysis and synthesis of
      the best data available concerning a given health problem. These factual data are
      accessible because of the availability on the Internet of web tools specialized
      in research for scientific publications. A bibliographic database is a collection
      of bibliographic references describing the documents indexed. Such a reference
      includes at least the title, summary (or abstract), a set of keywords, and the
      type of publication. To conduct a strategically effective search, it is necessary
      to formulate the question - clinical, diagnostic, prognostic, or related to
      treatment or prevention - in a form understandable by the research engine.
      Moreover, it is necessary to choose the specific database or databases, which may
      have particular specificity, and to analyze the results rapidly to refine the
      strategy. The search for information is facilitated by the knowledge of the
      standardized terms commonly used to describe the desired information. These come 
      from a specific thesaurus devoted to document indexing. The most frequently used 
      is MeSH (Medical Subject Heading). The principal bibliographic database whose
      references include a set of describers from the MeSH thesaurus is Medical
      Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), which has in turn
      become a subpart of a still more vast bibliography called PubMed, which indexes
      an additional 1.4 million references. Numerous other databases are maintained by 
      national or international entities. These include the Cochrane Library, Embase,
      and the PASCAL and FRANCIS databases.

TI  - Projection and inheritance of SNOMED CT relations between MeSH terms.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - This paper proposes a methodology to achieve the automatic inheritance of SNOMED 
      CT relations applied to MeSH preferred terms using UMLS as knowledge source
      server. We propose an interoperability wildcard to achieve this objective. A
      quantitative and a qualitative analysis were performed on top four SNOMED CT
      relations inherited between MeSH preferred terms. A total of 12,030 couples of
      MeSH preferred terms are in relation via at least one SNOMED CT relationship. For
      the top-four relations inherited between MeSH preferred terms, overall 79.25% of 
      them are relevant, 16.25% as intermediate and 4.5% as irrelevant, as judged by a 
      medical librarian. This work should lead to an optimization of multi-terminology 
      indexing tools, multi-terminology information retrieval and navigation among a
      multi-terminology server.

PG  - 187-202
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2008.00827.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People search medline for trials of healthcare interventions for
      clinical decisions, or to produce systematic reviews, practice guidelines, or
      technology assessments. Finding all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      with little extraneous material is challenging. OBJECTIVE: To provide comparative
      data on the operating characteristics of search filters designed to retrieve RCTs
      from medline. METHODS: We identified 38 filters. The testing database comprises
      handsearching data from 161 clinical journals indexed in medline. Sensitivity,
      specificity and precision were calculated. RESULTS: The number of terms and
      operating characteristics varied considerably. Comparing the retrieval against
      the single term 'randomized controlled trials.pt.' (sensitivity for retrieving
      RCTs, 93.7%), 24 of 38 filters had statistically higher sensitivity; 6 had a
      sensitivity of at least 99.0%. Four other filters had specificities (non
      retrieval of non-RCTs) that were statistically not different or better than the
      single term (97.6%). Precision was poor: only two filters had precision
      (proportion of retrieved articles that were RCTs) statistically similar to that
      of the single term (56.4%)-all others were lower. Filters with more search terms 
      often had lower specificity, especially at high sensitivities. CONCLUSION: Many
      RCT filters exist (n = 38). These comparative data can direct the choice of an
      RCT filter.

TI  - Gendoo: functional profiling of gene and disease features using MeSH vocabulary.
PG  - W166-9
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkp483 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide data enables us to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of
      complex phenotypes. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a widely
      employed knowledge base of human genes and genetic disorders for biological
      researchers. However, OMIM has not been fully exploited for omics analysis
      because its bibliographic data structure is not suitable for computer automation.
      Here, we characterized diseases and genes by generating feature profiles of
      associated drugs, biological phenomena and anatomy with the MeSH (Medical Subject
      Headings) vocabulary. We obtained 1 760 054 pairs of OMIM entries and MeSH terms 
      by utilizing the full set of MEDLINE articles. We developed a web-based
      application called Gendoo (gene, disease features ontology-based overview system)
      to visualize these profiles. By comparing feature profiles of types 1 and 2
      diabetes, we clearly illustrated their differences: type 1 diabetes is an
      autoimmune disease (P-value = 4.55 x 10(-5)) and type 2 diabetes is related to
      obesity (P-value = 1.18 x 10(-15)). Gendoo and the developed feature profiles
      should be useful for omics analysis from molecular and clinical viewpoints.
      Gendoo is available at http://gendoo.dbcls.jp/.

TI  - Enhancing MEDLINE document clustering by incorporating MeSH semantic similarity.
PG  - 1944-51
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp338 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Clustering MEDLINE documents is usually conducted by the vector space
      model, which computes the content similarity between two documents by basically
      using the inner-product of their word vectors. Recently, the semantic information
      of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) thesaurus is being applied to clustering
      MEDLINE documents by mapping documents into MeSH concept vectors to be clustered.
      However, current approaches of using MeSH thesaurus have two serious limitations:
      first, important semantic information may be lost when generating MeSH concept
      vectors, and second, the content information of the original text has been
      discarded. METHODS: Our new strategy includes three key points. First, we develop
      a sound method for measuring the semantic similarity between two documents over
      the MeSH thesaurus. Second, we combine both the semantic and content similarities
      to generate the integrated similarity matrix between documents. Third, we apply a
      spectral approach to clustering documents over the integrated similarity matrix. 
      RESULTS: Using various 100 datasets of MEDLINE records, we conduct extensive
      experiments with changing alternative measures and parameters. Experimental
      results show that integrating the semantic and content similarities outperforms
      the case of using only one of the two similarities, being statistically
      significant. We further find the best parameter setting that is consistent over
      all experimental conditions conducted. We finally show a typical example of
      resultant clusters, confirming the effectiveness of our strategy in improving
      MEDLINE document clustering. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are
      available at Bioinformatics online.

      Headings.
PG  - 77-83
LID - 10.3163/1536-5050.97.2.003 [doi]
AB  - In exploring new ways of teaching students how to use Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSH), librarians at Boston University's Alumni Medical Library (AML) integrated
      social tagging into their instruction. These activities were incorporated into
      the two-credit graduate course, "GMS MS 640: Introduction to Biomedical
      Information," required for all students in the graduate medical science program. 
      Hands-on assignments and in-class exercises enabled librarians to present MeSH
      and the concept of a controlled vocabulary in a familiar and relevant context for
      the course's Generation Y student population and provided students the
      opportunity to actively participate in creating their education. At the
      conclusion of these activities, students were surveyed regarding the clarity of
      the presentation of the MeSH vocabulary. Analysis of survey responses indicated
      that 46% found the concept of MeSH to be the clearest concept presented in the
      in-class intervention.

TI  - MeSH Up: effective MeSH text classification for improved document retrieval.
PG  - 1412-8
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp249 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Controlled vocabularies such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
      thesaurus and the Gene Ontology (GO) provide an efficient way of accessing and
      organizing biomedical information by reducing the ambiguity inherent to free-text
      data. Different methods of automating the assignment of MeSH concepts have been
      proposed to replace manual annotation, but they are either limited to a small
      subset of MeSH or have only been compared with a limited number of other systems.
      RESULTS: We compare the performance of six MeSH classification systems [MetaMap, 
      EAGL, a language and a vector space model-based approach, a K-Nearest Neighbor
      (KNN) approach and MTI] in terms of reproducing and complementing manual MeSH
      annotations. A KNN system clearly outperforms the other published approaches and 
      scales well with large amounts of text using the full MeSH thesaurus. Our
      measurements demonstrate to what extent manual MeSH annotations can be reproduced
      and how they can be complemented by automatic annotations. We also show that a
      statistically significant improvement can be obtained in information retrieval
      (IR) when the text of a user's query is automatically annotated with MeSH
      concepts, compared to using the original textual query alone. CONCLUSIONS: The
      annotation of biomedical texts using controlled vocabularies such as MeSH can be 
      automated to improve text-only IR. Furthermore, the automatic MeSH annotation
      system we propose is highly scalable and it generates improvements in IR
      comparable with those observed for manual annotations.

      for use on OvidSP.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-9-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many recently published clinical studies report sex-specific data.
      This information may help to improve clinical decision-making for both sexes, but
      it is not easily accessible in MEDLINE. The aim of this project was to develop
      and validate a search filter that would facilitate the retrieval of studies
      reporting high quality sex-specific data on clinical questions. METHODS: A filter
      was developed by screening titles, abstracts and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 
      in a set of 80 high quality and relevant papers, 75 of which were identified
      through a review of clinical guidelines and five through other means. The filter,
      for use on OvidSP, consists of nine command lines for searching free text words
      in the title, abstract and MeSH of a paper. It was able to identify 74/80 (92.5%)
      of the articles from which it was derived. The filter was evaluated in a set of
      622 recently published original studies on Alzheimer's disease and on asthma. It 
      was validated against a reference of 98 studies from this set, which provided
      high quality, clinically relevant, sex-specific evidence. Recall and precision
      were used as performance measures. RESULTS: The filter demonstrated 81/98 (83%)
      recall and 81/125 (65%) precision in retrieving relevant articles on Alzheimer's 
      disease and on asthma. In comparison, only 30/98 (31%) recall would have been
      achieved if sex-specific MeSH terms only had been used. CONCLUSION: This
      sex-specific search filter performs well in retrieving relevant papers, while its
      precision rate is good. It performs better than a search with sex-specific MeSH. 
      The filter can be useful to anyone seeking sex-specific clinical evidence (e.g., 
      guideline organizations, researchers, medical educators, clinicians).

TI  - A recent advance in the automatic indexing of the biomedical literature.
PG  - 814-23
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2008.12.007 [doi]
AB  - The volume of biomedical literature has experienced explosive growth in recent
      years. This is reflected in the corresponding increase in the size of MEDLINE,
      the largest bibliographic database of biomedical citations. Indexers at the US
      National Library of Medicine (NLM) need efficient tools to help them accommodate 
      the ensuing workload. After reviewing issues in the automatic assignment of
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) to biomedical text, we focus more
      specifically on the new subheading attachment feature for NLM's Medical Text
      Indexer (MTI). Natural Language Processing, statistical, and machine learning
      methods of producing automatic MeSH main heading/subheading pair recommendations 
      were assessed independently and combined. The best combination achieves 48%
      precision and 30% recall. After validation by NLM indexers, a suitable
      combination of the methods presented in this paper was integrated into MTI as a
      subheading attachment feature producing MeSH indexing recommendations compliant
      with current state-of-the-art indexing practice.

TI  - Publication trends in the medical informatics literature: 20 years of "Medical
      Informatics" in MeSH.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-9-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to identify publication output, and
      research areas, as well as descriptively and quantitatively characterize the
      field of medical informatics through publication trend analysis over a twenty
      year period (1987-2006). METHODS: A bibliometric analysis of medical informatics 
      citations indexed in Medline was performed using publication trends, journal
      frequency, impact factors, MeSH term frequencies and characteristics of
      citations. RESULTS: There were 77,023 medical informatics articles published
      during this 20 year period in 4,644 unique journals. The average annual article
      publication growth rate was 12%. The 50 identified medical informatics MeSH terms
      are rarely assigned together to the same document and are almost exclusively
      paired with a non-medical informatics MeSH term, suggesting a strong
      interdisciplinary trend. Trends in citations, journals, and MeSH categories of
      medical informatics output for the 20-year period are summarized. Average impact 
      factor scores and weighted average impact factor scores increased over the
      20-year period with two notable growth periods. CONCLUSION: There is a steadily
      growing presence and increasing visibility of medical informatics literature over
      the years. Patterns in research output that seem to characterize the historic
      trends and current components of the field of medical informatics suggest it may 
      be a maturing discipline, and highlight specific journals in which the medical
      informatics literature appears most frequently, including general medical
      journals as well as informatics-specific journals.

TI  - LigerCat: using "MeSH Clouds" from journal, article, or gene citations to
      facilitate the identification of relevant biomedical literature.
PG  - 563-7
AB  - The identification of relevant literature from within large collections is often 
      a challenging endeavor. In the context of indexed resources, such as MEDLINE, it 
      has been shown that keywords from a controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH) can be
      used in combination to retrieve relevant search results. One effective strategy
      for identifying potential search terms is to examine a collection of documents
      for frequently occurring terms. In this way, "Tag clouds" are a popular mechanism
      for ascertaining terms associated with a collection of documents. Here, we
      present the Literature and Genomic Electronic Resource Catalogue (LigerCat)
      system for exploring biomedical literature through the selection of terms within 
      a "MeSH cloud" that is generated based on an initial query using journal,
      article, or gene data. The resultant interface is encapsulated within a Web
      interface: http://ligercat.ubio.org. The system is also available for
      installation under an MIT license.

TI  - Multi-terminology indexing for the assignment of MeSH descriptors to medical
      abstracts in French.
PG  - 521-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: To facilitate information retrieval in the biomedical domain, a
      system for the automatic assignment of Medical Subject Headings to documents
      curated by an online quality-controlled health gateway was implemented. The
      French Multi-Terminology Indexer (F-MTI) implements a multiterminology approach
      using nine main medical terminologies in French and the mappings between them.
      OBJECTIVE: This paper presents recent efforts to assess the added value of (a)
      integrating four new terminologies (Orphanet, ATC, drug names, MeSH supplementary
      concepts) into F-MTI's knowledge sources and (b) performing the automatic
      indexing on the titles and abstracts (vs. title only) of the online health
      resources. METHODS: F-MTI was evaluated on a CISMeF corpus comprising 18,161
      manually indexed resources. RESULTS: The performance of F-MTI including nine
      health terminologies on CISMeF resources with Title only was 27.9% precision and 
      19.7% recall, while the performance on CISMeF resources with Title and Abstract
      is 14.9 % precision (-13.0%) and 25.9% recall (+6.2%). CONCLUSION: In a few
      weeks, CISMeF will launch the indexing of resources based on title and abstract, 
      using nine terminologies.

TI  - Generating quality word sense disambiguation test sets based on MeSH indexing.
PG  - 183-7
AB  - Word sense disambiguation (WSD) determines the correct meaning of a word that has
      more than one meaning, and is a critical step in biomedical natural language
      processing, as interpretation of information in text can be correct only if the
      meanings of their component terms are correctly identified first. Quality
      evaluation sets are important to WSD because they can be used as representative
      samples for developing automatic programs and as referees for comparing different
      WSD programs. To help create quality test sets for WSD, we developed a MeSH-based
      automatic sense-tagging method that preferentially annotates terms being topical 
      of the text. Preliminary results were promising and revealed important issues to 
      be addressed in biomedical WSD research. We also suggest that, by
      cross-validating with 2 or 3 annotators, the method should be able to efficiently
      generate quality WSD test sets. Online supplement is available at:

TI  - CleanEx: new data extraction and merging tools based on MeSH term annotation.
PG  - D880-4
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkn878 [doi]
AB  - The CleanEx expression database (http://www.cleanex.isb-sib.ch) provides access
      to public gene expression data via unique gene names as well as via experiments
      biomedical characteristics. To reach this, a dual annotation of both sequences
      and experiments has been generated. First, the system links official gene symbols
      to any kind of sequences used for gene expression measurements (cDNA, Affymetrix,
      oligonucleotide arrays, SAGE or MPSS tags, Expressed Sequence Tags or other mRNA 
      sequences, etc.). For the biomedical annotation, we re-annotate each experiment
      from the CleanEx database with the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms,
      primarily used by NLM (National Library of Medicine) for indexing articles for
      the MEDLINE/PubMED database. This annotation allows a fast and easy retrieval of 
      expression data with common biological or medical features. The numerical data
      can then be exported as matrix-like tab-delimited text files. Data can be
      extracted from either one dataset or from heterogeneous datasets.

TI  - Disambiguation of biomedical text using diverse sources of information.
PG  - S7
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-9-S11-S7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Like text in other domains, biomedical documents contain a range of
      terms with more than one possible meaning. These ambiguities form a significant
      obstacle to the automatic processing of biomedical texts. Previous approaches to 
      resolving this problem have made use of various sources of information including 
      linguistic features of the context in which the ambiguous term is used and
      domain-specific resources, such as UMLS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compare
      various sources of information including ones which have been previously used and
      a novel one: MeSH terms. Evaluation is carried out using a standard test set (the
      NLM-WSD corpus). RESULTS: The best performance is obtained using a combination of
      linguistic features and MeSH terms. Performance of our system exceeds previously 
      published results for systems evaluated using the same data set. CONCLUSION:
      Disambiguation of biomedical terms benefits from the use of information from a
      variety of sources. In particular, MeSH terms have proved to be useful and should
      be used if available.

TI  - Automatic inference of indexing rules for MEDLINE.
PG  - S11
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-9-S11-S11 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indexing is a crucial step in any information retrieval system. In
      MEDLINE, a widely used database of the biomedical literature, the indexing
      process involves the selection of Medical Subject Headings in order to describe
      the subject matter of articles. The need for automatic tools to assist MEDLINE
      indexers in this task is growing with the increasing number of publications being
      added to MEDLINE. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the use and the
      customization of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to infer indexing rules that
      may be used to produce automatic indexing recommendations for MEDLINE indexers.
      RESULTS: Our results show that this original ILP-based approach outperforms
      manual rules when they exist. In addition, the use of ILP rules also improves the
      overall performance of the Medical Text Indexer (MTI), a system producing
      automatic indexing recommendations for MEDLINE. CONCLUSION: We expect the sets of
      ILP rules obtained in this experiment to be integrated into MTI.

TI  - Linking test ordering with order tracking: closing the loop in ambulatory care.
PG  - 1131
AB  - Test non-completion decreases quality of care and accounts for many
      diagnosis-related malpractice claims. Currently, clinicians using Partners'
      electronic Longitudinal Medical Record (LMR) can track results but lack a
      mechanism for tracking non-completed tests. This pilot intervention will study an
      "order tracking" functionality that flags newly-ordered tests and will lead to
      generation of written patient reminders if tests are not completed within
      pre-specified timeframes. If test completion rates improve, we will pursue
      development of a dedicated LMR application.

TI  - Emerging trend prediction in biomedical literature.
PG  - 485-9
AB  - We present a study on how to predict new emerging trends in the biomedical domain
      based on textual data. We thereby propose a way of anticipating the
      transformation of arbitrary information into ground truth knowledge by predicting
      the inclusion of new terms into the MeSH ontology. We also discuss the
      preparation of a dataset for the evaluation of emerging trend prediction
      algorithms that is based on PubMed abstracts and related MeSH terms. The results 
      suggest that early prediction of emerging trends is possible.

TI  - A fast document classification algorithm for gene symbol disambiguation in the
      BITOLA literature-based discovery support system.
PG  - 358-62
AB  - Gene symbol disambiguation is an important problem for biomedical text mining
      systems. When detecting gene symbols in MEDLINE citations one of the biggest
      challenges is the fact that many gene symbols also denote other, more general
      biomedical concepts (e.g. CT, MR). Our approach to this problem is first to
      classify the citations into genetic and non-genetic domains and then to detect
      gene symbols only in the genetic domain. We used ontological information provided
      by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for this classification task. The proposed
      algorithm is fast and is able to process the full MEDLINE distribution in a few
      hours. It achieves predictive accuracy of 0.91. The algorithm is currently
      implemented in the BITOLA literature-based discovery support system
      (http://www.mf.uni-lj.si/bitola/).

TI  - Using multi-terminology indexing for the assignment of MeSH descriptors to health
      resources in a French online catalogue.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assist with the development of a French online quality-controlled 
      health gateway(CISMeF), an automatic indexing tool assigning MeSH descriptors to 
      medical text in French was created. The French Multi-Terminology Indexer (FMTI)
      relies on a multi-terminology approach involving four prominent medical
      terminologies and the mappings between them. OBJECTIVE: In this paper,we compare 
      lemmatization and stemming as methods to process French medical text for
      indexing. We also evaluate the multi-terminology approach implemented in F-MTI.
      METHODS: The indexing strategies were assessed on a corpus of 18,814 resources
      indexed manually. RESULTS: There is little difference in the indexing performance
      when lemmatization or stemming is used. However, the multi-terminology approach
      outperforms indexing relying on a single terminology in terms of recall.
      CONCLUSION: F-MTI will soon be used in the CISMeF production environment and in a
      Health MultiTerminology Server in French.

PG  - 1027
AB  - We propose a new method of evaluating the accuracy of machine translation by
      clinical weighting. Weight is determined by its importance in the clinical
      diagnosis. A new algorithm was developed based on clinical term weighting. We
      compared simple word alignment, clinical weighting algorithm and human review by 
      translation efficiency. The results were 65%, 86% and 90% respectively. This
      method encourages a quantitative evaluation of translation accuracy and
      facilitates automation. Clinical weighting promotes better evaluation.

TI  - An exploratory analysis of PubMed's free full-text limit on citation retrieval
      for clinical questions.
PG  - 351-5
LID - 10.3163/1536-5050.96.4.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The research sought to determine (1) how use of the PubMed free
      full-text (FFT) limit affects citation retrieval and (2) how use of the FFT limit
      impacts the types of articles and levels of evidence retrieved. METHODS: Four
      clinical questions based on a research agenda for physical therapy were searched 
      in PubMed both with and without the use of the FFT limit. Retrieved citations
      were examined for relevancy to each question. Abstracts of relevant citations
      were reviewed to determine the types of articles and levels of evidence.
      Descriptive analysis was used to compare the total number of citations, number of
      relevant citations, types of articles, and levels of evidence both with and
      without the use of the FFT limit. RESULTS: Across all 4 questions, the FFT limit 
      reduced the number of citations to 11.1% of the total number of citations
      retrieved without the FFT limit. Additionally, high-quality evidence such as
      systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were missed when the FFT
      limit was used. CONCLUSIONS: Health sciences librarians play a key role in
      educating users about the potential impact the FFT limit has on the number of
      citations, types of articles, and levels of evidence retrieved.

PG  - 1171
AB  - In the information portal environment, user profiles helps librarians to better
      understand users' needs and build individualized services. We have used a locally
      developed UMLS-based MeSH indexer to process and extract MeSH concept terms from 
      the contents of individuals' usage files on our library's portal system
      (MyWelch). The algorithm was also developed to refine these extracted terms and
      assign weights to individual terms. This process yielded a weighted MeSH term set
      for each individual user that can be considered to define the individual user's
      areas of research interest profile.

      strongly prefer to use their native language. Therefore, Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSH) translations would be helpful to those who are not fluent in English to
      access scientific papers indexed in the MEDLINE bibliographic database.
      Furthermore, medical terminologies such as MeSH are challenging in any language. 
      In this context, a French MeSH Browser was developed.

TI  - Fine-grained indexing of the biomedical literature: MeSH subheading attachment
      for a MEDLINE indexing tool.
PG  - 553-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on the latest results of an Indexing Initiative
      effort addressing the automatic attachment of subheadings to MeSH main headings
      recommended by the NLM's Medical Text Indexer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Several
      linguistic and statistical approaches are used to retrieve and attach the
      subheadings. Continuing collaboration with NLM indexers also provided insight on 
      how automatic methods can better enhance indexing practice. RESULTS: The methods 
      were evaluated on corpus of 50,000 MEDLINE citations. For main heading/subheading
      pair recommendations, the best precision is obtained with a post-processing rule 
      method (58%) while the best recall is obtained by pooling all methods (64%). For 
      stand-alone subheading recommendations, the best performance is obtained with the
      PubMed Related Citations algorithm. CONCLUSION: Significant progress has been
      made in terms of subheading coverage. After further evaluation, some of this work
      may be integrated in the MEDLINE indexing workflow.

TI  - Methodologies for extracting functional pharmacogenomic experiments from
      international repository.
PG  - 463-7
AB  - Pharmacogenomic studies are studies designed to elucidate the relationships
      between drugs and genes on the genomic scale. Given the rapidly increasing amount
      of microarray data in international repositories, and the implicit drug
      information contained in PubMed, MeSH and UMLS, we propose automatic methods for 
      identifying drug-related microarray experiments from NCBI GEO by the semantic
      connections between these data resources. In our study, we find that 51.5% of
      microarray experiments are associated with at least one PubMed identifier, 22.1% 
      of these contain a MeSH term that relates to the UMLS Pharmacologic Substances
      semantic sub-tree. Our work shows an abundance of publicly available gene
      expression data available to enable the discovery of novel drug indications, drug
      classifications and other pharmacogenomic studies.

TI  - InWiM: knowledge management for insurance medicine.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - Suva (Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund) is the most important carrier of
      obligatory accident insurance in Switzerland. Its services not only comprise
      insurance but also prevention, case management and rehabilitation. Suva's medical
      division supports doctors in stationary and ambulatory care with comprehensive
      case management and with conciliar advice. Two Suva clinics provide stationary
      rehabilitation. Medicine in general, including insurance medicine, faces the
      problem of a diversity of opinions about the facts of a case. One of the reasons 
      is a diversity of knowledge. This is the reason why Suva initiated a knowledge
      management project called InWiM. "InWiM" is the acronym for "Integrierte
      Wissensbasen der Medizin" which can be translated as "Integrated Knowledge Bases 
      in Medicine". The project is part of an ISO 9001 certification program and
      comprises the definition and documentation of all processes in the field of
      knowledge management as well as the development of the underlying ITC
      infrastructure. The knowledge representation model used for the ICT
      implementation considers knowledge as a multidimensional network of interlinked
      units of information. In contrast to the hyperlink technology in the World Wide
      Web, links between items are bidirectional: the target knows the source of the
      link. Links are therefore called cross-links. The model allows annotation for the
      narrative description of the nature of the units of information (e.g. documents) 
      and the cross-links as well. Information retrieval is achieved by means of a full
      implementation of the MeSH Index, the thesaurus of the United States National
      Library of Medicine (NLM). As far as the authors are aware, InWiM is currently
      the only implementation worldwide - with the exception of the NLM and its
      national representatives - which supports all MeSH features for in-house
      retrieval.

PG  - 101-9
AB  - The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to using databases from the
      Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge, with special reference to Citation Indexes as an
      analysis tool for publications, and also to explain the meaning of the well-known
      Impact Factor. We present the partially modified new Consultation Interface to
      enhance information search routines of these databases. It introduces distinctive
      methods in search bibliography, including the correct application of analysis
      tools, paying particular attention to Journal Citation Reports and Impact Factor.
      We finish this article with comment on the consequences of using the Impact
      Factor as a quality indicator for the assessment of journals and publications,
      and how to ensure measures for indexing in the Thomson ISI Databases.

TI  - Automatically created concept graphs using descriptive keywords in the medical
      domain.
PG  - 241-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides keyword search, navigational search is an important means to 
      find relevant information in digital object collections. Such navigation is often
      supported by categorization systems or thesauri, which provide a hierarchical
      view on a particular domain and allow for browsing digital collections. Existing 
      categorization systems, however, require large and expensive efforts for the
      manual creation and maintenance. Our Semantic GrowBag algorithm fully
      automatically creates concept graphs, i.e. directed graphs similar to
      categorization systems but without strong subsumption semantics. This article
      sketches our algorithm and evaluates it for the medical domain. METHODS: Our
      Semantic GrowBag algorithm uses descriptive keywords and exploits higher-order
      co-occurrences between them to create concept graphs (so-called GrowBag graphs)
      from annotated object collections. In this study, we have automatically created
      more than 2000 GrowBag graphs based on the Medline data set to show the
      applicability of our algorithm in the medical domain. For the evaluation, we
      first compared our algorithm to a baseline algorithm that does not take
      higher-order co-occurrences into account, and then compared the resulting GrowBag
      graphs systematically against the manually crafted MeSH thesaurus. RESULTS: Our
      experiments revealed that the Semantic GrowBag approach essentially increases the
      number of relevant relationships in comparison to a baseline approach by about
      50%. Furthermore, the identified relations usually correspond to and hardly ever 
      contradict to relationships as stated by MeSH. CONCLUSIONS: The Semantic GrowBag 
      algorithm allows creating concept graphs fully automatically. While it does not
      systematically exploit specifics of a domain (such as the fundamental separation 
      between 'drugs' and 'therapy' in MeSH), the resulting GrowBag graphs are
      nevertheless well-suited to support navigation in digital object collections.
      Moreover, they can also be used to help maintaining existing categorization
      systems based on the actual usage of categories.

TI  - Optimal training sets for Bayesian prediction of MeSH assignment.
PG  - 546-53
LID - 10.1197/jamia.M2431 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to improve naive Bayes prediction of
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) assignment to documents using optimal training
      sets found by an active learning inspired method. DESIGN: The authors selected 20
      MeSH terms whose occurrences cover a range of frequencies. For each MeSH term,
      they found an optimal training set, a subset of the whole training set. An
      optimal training set consists of all documents including a given MeSH term (C1
      class) and those documents not including a given MeSH term (C(-1) class) that are
      closest to the C1 class. These small sets were used to predict MeSH assignments
      in the MEDLINE database. MEASUREMENTS: Average precision was used to compare MeSH
      assignment using the naive Bayes learner trained on the whole training set,
      optimal sets, and random sets. The authors compared 95% lower confidence limits
      of average precisions of naive Bayes with upper bounds for average precisions of 
      a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. RESULTS: For all 20 MeSH assignments, the 
      optimal training sets produced nearly 200% improvement over use of the whole
      training sets. In 17 of those MeSH assignments, naive Bayes using optimal
      training sets was statistically better than a KNN. In 15 of those, optimal
      training sets performed better than optimized feature selection. Overall naive
      Bayes averaged 14% better than a KNN for all 20 MeSH assignments. Using these
      optimal sets with another classifier, C-modified least squares (CMLS), produced
      an additional 6% improvement over naive Bayes. CONCLUSION: Using a smaller
      optimal training set greatly improved learning with naive Bayes. The performance 
      is superior to a KNN. The small training set can be used with other sophisticated
      learning methods, such as CMLS, where using the whole training set would not be
      feasible.

TI  - BioCompass: a novel functional inference tool that utilizes MeSH hierarchy to
      analyze groups of genes.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - Microarray technology has become employed widely for biological researchers to
      identify genes associated with conditions such as diseases and drugs. To date,
      many methods have been developed to analyze data covering a large number of
      genes, but they focus only on statistical significance and cannot decipher the
      data with biological concepts. Gene Ontology (GO) is utilized to understand the
      data with biological interpretation; however, it is restricted to specific
      ontology such as biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. 
      Here, we attempted to apply MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) to interpret groups
      of genes from biological viewpoint. To assign MeSH terms to genes, in this study,
      contexts associated with genes are retrieved from full set of MEDLINE data using 
      machine learning, and then extracted MeSH terms from retrieved articles.
      Utilizing the developed method, we implemented a software called BioCompass. It
      generates high-scoring lists and hierarchical lists for diseases MeSH terms
      associated with groups of genes to utilize MeSH and GO tree, and illustrated a
      wiring diagram by linking genes with extracted association from articles.
      Researchers can easily retrieve genes and keywords of interest, such as diseases 
      and drugs, associated with groups of genes. Using retrieved MeSH terms and OMIM
      in conjunction with, we could obtain more disease information associated with
      target gene. BioCompass helps researchers to interpret groups of genes such as
      microarray data from a biological viewpoint.

TI  - OSIRISv1.2: a named entity recognition system for sequence variants of genes in
      biomedical literature.
PG  - 84
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-9-84 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, among other type of sequence
      variants, constitute key elements in genetic epidemiology and pharmacogenomics.
      While sequence data about genetic variation is found at databases such as dbSNP, 
      clues about the functional and phenotypic consequences of the variations are
      generally found in biomedical literature. The identification of the relevant
      documents and the extraction of the information from them are hampered by the
      large size of literature databases and the lack of widely accepted standard
      notation for biomedical entities. Thus, automatic systems for the identification 
      of citations of allelic variants of genes in biomedical texts are required.
      RESULTS: Our group has previously reported the development of OSIRIS, a system
      aimed at the retrieval of literature about allelic variants of genes
      http://ibi.imim.es/osirisform.html. Here we describe the development of a new
      version of OSIRIS (OSIRISv1.2, http://ibi.imim.es/OSIRISv1.2.html) which
      incorporates a new entity recognition module and is built on top of a local
      mirror of the MEDLINE collection and HgenetInfoDB: a database that collects data 
      on human gene sequence variations. The new entity recognition module is based on 
      a pattern-based search algorithm for the identification of variation terms in the
      texts and their mapping to dbSNP identifiers. The performance of OSIRISv1.2 was
      evaluated on a manually annotated corpus, resulting in 99% precision, 82% recall,
      and an F-score of 0.89. As an example, the application of the system for
      collecting literature citations for the allelic variants of genes related to the 
      diseases intracranial aneurysm and breast cancer is presented. CONCLUSION:
      OSIRISv1.2 can be used to link literature references to dbSNP database entries
      with high accuracy, and therefore is suitable for collecting current knowledge on
      gene sequence variations and supporting the functional annotation of variation
      databases. The application of OSIRISv1.2 in combination with controlled
      vocabularies like MeSH provides a way to identify associations of biomedical
      interest, such as those that relate SNPs with diseases.

TI  - Deja vu--a study of duplicate citations in Medline.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - MOTIVATION: Duplicate publication impacts the quality of the scientific corpus,
      has been difficult to detect, and studies this far have been limited in scope and
      size. Using text similarity searches, we were able to identify signatures of
      duplicate citations among a body of abstracts. RESULTS: A sample of 62,213
      Medline citations was examined and a database of manually verified duplicate
      citations was created to study author publication behavior. We found that 0.04%
      of the citations with no shared authors were highly similar and are thus
      potential cases of plagiarism. 1.35% with shared authors were sufficiently
      similar to be considered a duplicate. Extrapolating, this would correspond to
      3500 and 117,500 duplicate citations in total, respectively. AVAILABILITY:

TI  - Efficient bibliographic searches on allergology using PubMed.
PG  - 264-75
AB  - INTRODUCTION: PubMed is the most important of the non-specialized databases on
      biomedical literature. International and quickly updated is elaborated by the
      American Government and contains only information about papers published in
      scientific journal/s. Although it can be used as an unique Data Base, as a matter
      of fact is the addition of several subgroups (among them MEDLINE) that can be
      searched simultaneously. OBJECTIVES: To present the main characteristics of
      PubMed, as well as the most important procedures of search, for obtaining
      efficient results in searches on allergology. CHARACTERISTICS AND SEARCH
      PROCEDURES: PubMed is elaborated by the American Administration, that condition
      the character of the registered papers, 90 % of them are written in English in
      American (50 %) or British (20 %) Journals. Because of this, the information for 
      certain specialties or countries must be obtained from other sources. This paper 
      shows how PubMed allows to search in natural language due to the Automatic Term
      Mapping that links terms from the natural language with the descriptors producing
      searches with a higher sensitivity although with a low specificity. Nevertheless 
      the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) thesaurus allows to translate those terms
      from the natural language to the equivalent descriptor, as well as to make
      queries in the PubMed's documental language with a high specificity but with
      lower sensitivity than the natural language. The use of union (OR), intersection 
      (AND) and exclusion (NOT) operators, as well as tags, such as delimiters of the
      search fields, allows to increase the specificity of the results. Similar results
      may be obtained with the use of Limits. Searches done using Clinical Queries are 
      very interesting due to their direct clinical application and because allow to
      find systematic reviews, metaanalysis or clinically oriented papers (treatment,
      diagnostic, etiology, prognosis or clinical prediction guides) on the area of
      interest. Other procedures such as the Index, History of searches, and the
      widening of the selection using Related Articles and the storing of separate
      results in the Clipboard to be kept by the user, are presented in this paper.

TI  - An active visual search interface for Medline.
PG  - 359-69
AB  - Searching the Medline database is almost a daily necessity for many biomedical
      researchers. However, available Medline search solutions are mainly designed for 
      the quick retrieval of a small set of most relevant documents. Because of this
      search model, they are not suitable for the large-scale exploration of literature
      and the underlying biomedical conceptual relationships, which are common tasks in
      the age of high throughput experimental data analysis and cross-discipline
      research. We try to develop a new Medline exploration approach by incorporating
      interactive visualization together with powerful grouping, summary, sorting and
      active external content retrieval functions. Our solution, PubViz, is based on
      the FLEX platform designed for interactive web applications and its prototype is 
      publicly available at:
      http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/DataMining/PubViz.

TI  - Using MeSH to search for alternatives to the use of animals in research.
PG  - 55-74
AB  - Searching for alternatives to using animals in research is not a standard service
      currently offered by most medical research libraries. The goal of this article is
      to demystify this type of expert search for medical librarians and to do so using
      a language they know well, that of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus.
      An attempt is made in this paper to discuss possible search strategies and to
      include examples of recommended approaches to searching-all in the context of the
      3Rs of alternatives: Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction.

TI  - PICO Linguist and BabelMeSH: development and partial evaluation of evidence-based
      multilanguage search tools for MEDLINE/PubMed.
PG  - 817-21
AB  - PICO Linguist and BabelMeSH are multilanguage search tools intended for users
      whose native language is not English. A database of medical terms was created
      using concept identification equivalents of English terms to other languages. The
      primary sources of vocabularies were UMLS, MeSH, WHO EMRO and UMLF. The search
      interface changes according to the language selected which allows search terms to
      be entered in the native language. The user can limit the search output according
      to the language of publication but citations retrieved are in English only. Links
      may be provided to journals if published online. Evaluation of the French and
      Spanish versions using journal key words and a list of common diseases showed
      77.5% and 86.5% accuracy respectively. User feedback was positive. PICO Linguist 
      and BabelMeSH could be useful and convenient tools in finding current evidence
      sources in the medical literature especially for non-English medical terms that
      may be difficult to express in English.

TI  - Assigning categorical information to Japanese medical terms using MeSH and
      MEDLINE.
PG  - 694-8
AB  - This paper reports on the assigning of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) categories
      to Japanese terms in an English-Japanese dictionary using the titles and
      abstracts of articles indexed in MEDLINE. In a previous study, 30,000 of 80,000
      terms in the dictionary were mapped to MeSH terms by normalized comparison. It
      was reasoned that if the remaining dictionary terms appeared in MEDLINE-indexed
      articles that are indexed using MeSH terms, then relevancies between the
      dictionary terms and MeSH terms could be calculated, and thus MeSH categories
      assigned. This study compares two approaches for calculating the weight matrix.
      One is the TF*IDF method and the other uses the inner product of two weight
      matrices. About 20,000 additional dictionary terms were identified in
      MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2004. The precision and
      recall of these algorithms were evaluated separately for MeSH terms and non-MeSH 
      terms. Unfortunately, the precision and recall of the algorithms was not good,
      but this method will help with manual assignment of MeSH categories to dictionary
      terms.

TI  - Evaluation of a simple method for the automatic assignment of MeSH descriptors to
      health resources in a French online catalogue.
PG  - 407-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing number of resources to be indexed in the catalogue of
      online health resources in French (CISMeF) calls for curating strategies
      involving automatic indexing tools while maintaining the catalogue's high
      indexing quality standards. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple automatic tool that
      retrieves MeSH descriptors from documents titles. METHODS: In parallel to
      research on advanced indexing methods, a bag-of-words tool was developed for
      timely inclusion in CISMeF's maintenance system. An evaluation was carried out on
      a corpus of 99 documents. The indexing sets retrieved by the automatic tool were 
      compared to manual indexing based on the title and on the full text of resources.
      RESULTS: 58% of the major main headings were retrieved by the bag-of-words
      algorithm and the precision on main heading retrieval was 69%. CONCLUSION:
      Bag-of-words indexing has effectively been used on selected resources to be
      included in CISMeF since August 2006. Meanwhile, on going work aims at improving 
      the current version of the tool.

AB  - The PubMed search engine is an essential tool to stay abreast of the latest
      medical literature on specific topics. While the basic search techniques are
      common knowledge, the ability to use medical subject headings properly is an
      essential in obtaining valuable references. The purpose of this article is to
      explain what medical subject headings are and how they can be used to improve the
      results of reference searches in PubMed.

AB  - Methods are described to take a list of genes generated from a microarray
      experiment and interpret these results using various tools and ontologies. A
      workflow is described that details how to convert gene identifiers with SOURCE
      and MatchMiner and then use these converted gene lists to search the gene
      ontology (GO) and the medical subject headings (MeSH) ontology. Examples of
      searching GO with DAVID, EASE, and GOMiner are provided along with an
      interpretation of results. The mining of MeSH using high-density array pattern
      interpreter with a set of gene identifiers is also described.

TI  - The sensitivity and precision of search terms in Phases I, II and III of the
      Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying reports of randomized
      trials in medline in a specific area of health care--HIV/AIDS prevention and
      treatment interventions.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To detect term(s) in the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy
      (HSSS) that retain high sensitivity but improve precision in retrieving reports
      of trials in the PubMed version of medline. METHODS: Individual terms from the
      PubMed version of the HSSS were added, term by term, to an African HIV/AIDS
      strategy to identify reports of trials in medline using PubMed. The titles and
      abstracts of the records retrieved were read by two handsearchers and checked by 
      a clinical epidemiologist. The sensitivity and precision of each term in the
      three phases of the HSSS were calculated. RESULTS: Of 7,719 records retrieved,
      285 were identified as reports of trials [204 randomized (RCTs); 81 possibly
      randomized or quasi-randomized (CCTs)]. Phase III had the highest sensitivity
      (92%). Overall, precision was very low (3.7%). One term, 'random*[tw]', retrieved
      all RCTs found by our search and improved precision to 29%. The least sensitive
      terms, yielding no records, were '(doubl* AND mask*)[tw]' and terms containing
      'trebl*' or 'tripl*', except for '(tripl* AND blind*)[tw]'. The highest precision
      per term was for 'Double-blind Method [MeSH]' (76%). CONCLUSIONS: To retrieve all
      RCTs and CCTs found by our search, seven terms are needed but precision remains
      low (4.3%). Developments in the methods of search strategy design may help to
      improve precision while retaining high levels of sensitivity by identifying
      term(s) which occur frequently in relevant records and are the most efficient at 
      discriminating between different study designs.

TI  - Multilabel associative classification categorization of MEDLINE articles into
      MeSH keywords.
PG  - 47-55
AB  - The specific characteristic of classification of medical documents from the
      MEDLINE database is that each document is assigned to more than one category,
      which requires a system for multilabel classification. Another major challenge
      was to develop a scalable method capable of dealing with hundreds of thousand of 
      documents. We proposed a novel system for automated classification of MEDLINE
      documents to MeSH keywords based on the recently developed data mining algorithm 
      called ACRI, which was modified to accommodate multilabel classification. Five
      different classification configurations in conjunction with different methods of 
      measuring classification quality were proposed and tested. The extensive
      experimental comparison showed superiority of methods based on reoccurrence of
      words in an article over nonrecurrent-based associative classification. The
      achieved relatively high value of macro F1 (46%) demonstrates the high quality of
      the proposed system for this challenging dataset. Accuracy of the proposed
      classifier, defined as the ratio of the sum of TP and TN examples to the total
      number of examples, reached 90%. Three scenarios were proposed based on the
      performed tests and different possible objectives. If a goal is to classify the
      largest number of documents, a configuration that maximizes micro F1 should be
      chosen. On the other hand, if a system is to work well for categories with a
      small number of documents, a configuration that maximizes macro F1 is more
      suitable. A tradeoff can be obtained by using a configuration that optimizes the 
      average between macro and micro F1.

PG  - 145-8
AB  - Based on MeSH-2004, we constructed a Learning Science related phenotype Ontology 
      with active server page (ASP) and database technology. It provides a canonical,
      systemic and structural term system for the study of learning science and its
      phenotypes include terms of behavior,psychology and mental disorder. By using
      this Ontology, we can integrate isomerous data. It will increase the efficiency
      of information acquisition, management and search,and provide a platform for data
      sharing and data mining.

TI  - Doc'UMVF: two search tools to provide quality-controlled teaching resources in
      French to students and teachers.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - The UMVF project is a federation of medical teaching resources covering 32
      medical schools in France. Today, the indexing of these resources is carried out 
      manually by the CISMeF team at the University Hospital of Rouen. This indexing is
      based on MeSH thesaurus. We use a subset of SCORM metadata standard. This choice 
      was defined in collaboration with the French Medical Virtual University
      consortium (French acronym: UMVF). Currently, with the UMVF searching tool
      (called Doc'UMVF), medical students can reach more than 3300 resources useful in 
      their curriculum. Doc'UMVF is developed in close collaboration between the
      medical informatics laboratories of Rennes and Rouen. In this paper we present
      two complementary searching tools based on different methods and which are
      integrated and used to improve both the relevance and the coverage rate of the
      answers. A specific searching module has been built to retrieve specific
      resources concerning the National Medical Exam ENC ("Examen National Classant")
      is also available. Nevertheless, due to lack of time, numerous resources are not 
      yet indexed. Therefore we have decided to use also automatic indexing method
      (Nomindex). This approach will be improved by further research works, resulting
      from Rouen and Geneva teams. After having built a searching meta-motor, our
      objective is to develop a meta-tool intended to index the whole set of digital
      pedagogical resources produced by the UMVF framework. This manual re-indexing
      will be carried out only for the most important resources (national references), 
      with a more or less fine granularity.

TI  - Literature based discovery of gene clusters using phylogenetic methods.
PG  - 689-93
AB  - Biomedical literature can offer valuable information for organizing genes
      associated with the etiology and pathogenesis of disease. In this study, we
      demonstrate the utility of existing phylogenetic methods for organizing 375 genes
      associated with Breast Cancer using the MeSH annotations from over 35,000 Medline
      articles. Specifically, we compare the clustering (using the Colless Imbalance
      Index, Ic) of distance-based methods, which are used by popular phylogenetic
      clustering algorithms, and a character- based method (Maximum Parsimony) that is 
      commonly used for phylogenetic studies. Focusing on genes that cluster around
      BRCA1 and BRCA2, we examine the relevance of the clustered genes proposed by the 
      different clustering methods based on the number of exclusive MeSH terms. Our
      results indicate that existing phylogenetic methods and associated metrics can be
      used for organizing genes according to annotated knowledge in biomedical
      literature.

TI  - Mining cross-terminology links in the UMLS.
PG  - 624-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore link mining approaches over transitive relationship paths
      in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The goal is to classify relevant
      and 'interesting' cross-terminology links/paths for integration of Electronic
      Health Records (EHRs) and information resources. METHODS: We present approaches
      for using the link semantics as learning features, sampling the UMLS to create
      training examples, and ranking the classified links. We use the clinical query
      and MEDLINE pairs in the OHSUMED dataset to extract 'gold-links' between
      SNOMED-CT and MeSH respectively, and compare them against corresponding two-step 
      transitive links generated from the UMLS. RESULTS: a). 75.7% increase in
      reachable MeSH concepts with two-step links as compared to direct one-step links 
      b). 94.08% recall after link classification. CONCLUSION: Using link mining with
      the UMLS is a promising approach for inter-terminology translation; further
      research is needed to handle the exponential link growth.

PG  - 589-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper explores alternative approaches for the evaluation of an
      automatic indexing tool for MEDLINE, complementing the traditional precision and 
      recall method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The performance of MTI, the Medical Text
      Indexer used at NLM to produce MeSH recommendations for biomedical journal
      articles is evaluated on a random set of MEDLINE citations. The evaluation
      examines semantic similarity at the term level (indexing terms). In addition, the
      documents retrieved by queries resulting from MTI index terms for a given
      document are compared to the PubMed related citations for this document. RESULTS:
      Semantic similarity scores between sets of index terms are higher than the
      corresponding Dice similarity scores. Overall, 75% of the original documents and 
      58% of the top ten related citations are retrieved by queries based on the
      automatic indexing. CONCLUSIONS: The alternative measures studied in this paper
      confirm previous findings and may be used to select particular documents from the
      test set for a more thorough analysis.

TI  - Overcoming terminology barrier using Web resources for cross-language medical
      information retrieval.
PG  - 519-23
AB  - A number of authoritative medical websites, such as PubMed and MedlinePlus,
      provide consumers with the most up-to-date health information. However,
      non-English speakers often encounter not only language barriers (from other
      languages to English) but also terminology barriers (from laypersons inverted
      exclamation mark| terms to professional medical terms) when retrieving
      information from these websites. Our previous work address language barriers by
      developing a multilingual medical thesaurus, Chinese-English MeSH, while this
      study presents an approach to overcome terminology barriers based on Web
      resources. Two techniques were utilized in our approach: monolingual concept
      mapping using approximate string matching and crosslingual concept mapping using 
      Web resources. The evaluation shows that our approach can significantly improve
      the performance on MeSH concept mapping and cross-language medical information
      retrieval.

PG  - 409-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to improve the indexing of French-language health web sites by
      emphasizing the major terms that best describe them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: this
      study exploits both UMLS knowledge sources and results of previous research. It
      proposes a method for ranking MeSH terms taken from each record in order of
      relevance. The method is tested on a corpus of records taken from the
      French-language health gateway CISMeF. RESULTS: the results of the experiment are
      compared to those of a preliminary study performed on a corpus taken from
      MEDLINE. DISCUSSION: the ultimate objective of this work is to interface the
      developed tools with an automated MeSH term extractor in order to propose an
      automated indexing engine for French-language health web sites.

TI  - Finding disease-related genomic experiments within an international repository:
      first steps in translational bioinformatics.
PG  - 106-10
AB  - The amount of gene expression data in international repositories has grown
      exponentially. An important first step in translating the results of genomic
      experiments into medicine is to relate these genomic experiments to the human
      diseases they have studied. Unfortunately, repositories for expression data store
      the crucial annotative details only as free-text, making it manually intractable 
      to link these with human disease. In this study, we sought to find experiments in
      NCBI GEO that are related to human diseases by making use of annotations relating
      these experiments with PUBMED identifiers representing the publication in which
      each experiment was published. In this manner, we find that 35% of
      PUBMED-associated genomic experiments can be related to a human disease, and that
      publicly-available data from these genomic experiments can already be related to 
      over 270 human diseases and conditions. This represents an important first step
      in bridging the world of nucleotides, transcripts and expression with the
      afflications of us all.

TI  - Age-specific search strategies for Medline.
PG  - e25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many clinicians and researchers are interested in patients of a
      specific age (childhood, geriatrics, and so on). Searching for age-specific
      publications in large bibliographic databases such as Medline is problematic
      because of inconsistencies in indexing, overlapping age categories, and the
      spread of the relevant literature over many journals. To our knowledge, no
      empirically tested age-specific search strategies exist for Medline. OBJECTIVE:
      We sought to determine the retrieval characteristics of age-specific terms in
      Medline for identifying studies relevant for five clinical specialties: adult
      medicine, geriatric medicine, pediatric medicine, neonatal medicine, and
      obstetrics. METHODS: We compared age-specific search terms and phrases for the
      retrieval of citations in Medline with a manual hand search of the literature for
      161 core health care journals. Six experienced research assistants who were
      trained and intensively calibrated read all issues of 161 journals for the
      publishing year 2000. In addition to classifying all articles for purpose and
      quality, study participants' ages were also recorded. Outcome measures were
      sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of single and combination
      search terms. RESULTS: When maximizing sensitivity, the best sensitivity and
      specificity achieved with combination terms were 98% and 81.2%, respectively, for
      pediatric medicine, 96.4% and 55.9% for geriatric medicine, 95.3% and 83.6% for
      neonatal medicine, 94.9% and 64.5% for adult medicine, and 82% and 97.1% for
      obstetrics. When specificity was maximized, all disciplines had an expected
      decrease in sensitivity and an increase in precision. Highest values for
      optimizing best sensitivity and specificity were achieved in neonatal medicine,
      92.5% and 92.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Selected single terms and combinations
      of MeSH terms and textwords can reliably retrieve age-specific studies cited in
      Medline.

TI  - Ontology annotation treebrowser : an interactive tool where the complementarity
      of medical subject headings and gene ontology improves the interpretation of gene
      lists.
PG  - 225-36
AB  - Gene expression and proteomics analysis allow the investigation of thousands of
      biomolecules in parallel. This results in a long list of interesting genes or
      proteins and a list of annotation terms in the order of thousands. It is not a
      trivial task to understand such a gene list and it would require extensive
      efforts to bring together the overwhelming amounts of associated information from
      the literature and databases. Thus, it is evident that we need ways of condensing
      and filtering this information. An excellent way to represent knowledge is to use
      ontologies, where it is possible to group genes or terms with overlapping
      context, rather than studying one-dimensional lists of keywords. Therefore, we
      have built the ontology annotation treebrowser (OAT) to represent, condense,
      filter and summarise the knowledge associated with a list of genes or proteins.
      The OAT system consists of two disjointed parts; a MySQL database named OATdb,
      and a treebrowser engine that is implemented as a web interface. The OAT system
      is implemented using Perl scripts on an Apache web server and the gene, ontology 
      and annotation data is stored in a relational MySQL database. In OAT, we have
      harmonized the two ontologies of medical subject headings (MeSH) and gene
      ontology (GO), to enable us to use knowledge both from the literature and the
      annotation projects in the same tool. OAT includes multiple gene identifier sets,
      which are merged internally in the OAT database. We have also generated novel
      MeSH annotations by mapping accession numbers to MEDLINE entries. The ontology
      browser OAT was created to facilitate the analysis of gene lists. It can be
      browsed dynamically, so that a scientist can interact with the data and govern
      the outcome. Test statistics show which branches are enriched. We also show that 
      the two ontologies complement each other, with surprisingly low overlap, by
      mapping annotations to the Unified Medical Language System. We have developed a
      novel interactive annotation browser that is the first to incorporate both MeSH
      and GO for improved interpretation of gene lists. With OAT, we illustrate the
      benefits of combining MeSH and GO for understanding gene lists. OAT is available 
      as a public web service at: http://www.ifm.liu.se/bioinfo/oat.

TI  - A flexible integration and visualisation system for biomarker discovery.
PG  - 219-23
AB  - Biological data have accumulated at an unprecedented pace as a result of
      improvements in molecular technologies. However, the translation of data into
      information, and subsequently into knowledge, requires the intricate interplay of
      data access, visualisation and interpretation. Biological data are complex and
      are organised either hierarchically or non-hierarchically. For non-hierarchically
      organised data, it is difficult to view relationships among biological facts. In 
      addition, it is difficult to make changes in underlying data storage without
      affecting the visualisation interface. Here, we demonstrate a platform where
      non-hierarchically organised data can be visualised through the application of a 
      customised hierarchy incorporating medical subject headings (MeSH)
      classifications. This platform gives users flexibility in updating and
      manipulation. It can also facilitate fresh scientific insight by highlighting
      biological impacts across different hierarchical branches. An example of the
      integration of biomarker information from the curated Proteome database using
      MeSH and the StarTree visualisation tool is presented.

TI  - Specific classification of elibrary resources says more about users' preferences.
PG  - 719-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are a hierarchical taxonomy of over
      42,000 descriptors designed to classify scientific literature; it is hierarchical
      with generic high order headings and specific low order headings. Over 1,000
      resources in the Primary Care Electronic Library (PCEL - www.pcel.info) were
      classified with MeSH. METHODS: Each of the entries or resources in the primary
      care digital library was assigned up to five MeSH terms. We compared whether the 
      most generic or specific MeSH term ascribed to each resource best predicted user 
      preferences. RESULTS: over the four month period analysed statistically
      significant differences were found for resources according to specific key MeSH
      terms they were classified by. This result was not repeated for generic key MeSH 
      terms. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the use of specific MeSH terms reveals user
      preferences that would have otherwise remained obscured. These preferences are
      not found if more generic MeSH terms are analysed.

TI  - Mapping of medical acronyms and initialisms to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
      across selected systems.
PG  - 410-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Given the common use of acronyms and initialisms in the health
      sciences, searchers may be entering these abbreviated terms rather than full
      phrases when searching online systems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      how various MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) interfaces map acronyms and
      initialisms to the MeSH vocabulary. METHODS: The interfaces used in this study
      were: the PubMed MeSH database, the PubMed Automatic Term Mapping feature, the
      NLM Gateway Term Finder, and Ovid MEDLINE. Acronyms and initialisms were randomly
      selected from 2 print sources. The test data set included 415 randomly selected
      acronyms and initialisms whose related meanings were found to be MeSH terms. Each
      acronym and initialism was entered into each MEDLINE MeSH interface to determine 
      if it mapped to the corresponding MeSH term. Separately, 46 commonly used
      acronyms and initialisms were tested. RESULTS: While performance differed widely,
      the success rates were low across all interfaces for the randomly selected terms.
      The common acronyms and initialisms tested at higher success rates across the
      interfaces, but the differences between the interfaces remained. CONCLUSION:
      Online interfaces do not always map medical acronyms and initialisms to their
      corresponding MeSH phrases. This may lead to inaccurate results and missed
      information if acronyms and initialisms are used in search strategies.

TI  - Health economic evaluations: how to find them.
PG  - 512-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the best way of identifying 
      all relevant published health economic evaluation studies, which have increased
      in number rapidly in the past few decades. Nevertheless, health technology
      assessment projects are often faced with a scarcity of relevant studies. METHODS:
      Six bibliographic databases were searched using various individually adapted
      strategies. The particular example involves the cost-effectiveness of diagnosing 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were
      formulated. RESULTS: After irrelevant studies and duplicates had been excluded,
      sixty-eight abstracts were reviewed. We chose forty-one of them as relevant for
      full-text review, which identified fourteen papers as having met the inclusion
      criteria. Most of the relevant studies were identified by searching the National 
      Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and PubMed databases.
      CONCLUSIONS: A search in NHS EED, by means of the Cochrane Library or the Center 
      for Reviews and Dissimination, along with a supplementary search in PubMed, is
      generally an appropriate, cost-effective strategy. However, because
      "cost-effectiveness" is not consistently indexed with Medical Subject Heading
      terms in PubMed, all economic search terms need to be used to fully identify the 
      relevant references.

PG  - 303-8
AB  - Efficient literature search is essential to the practice of Evidence-Based
      Medicine. PubMed provides free access to one of the largest searchable biomedical
      databases. Efficient literature search using PubMed requires a good understanding
      of the available search strategies and tools. In this article we present a
      step-by-step approach for performing literature search using PubMed. Several
      PubMed tools including 'Single Citation Matcher', 'Clinical Queries',
      'Clipboard', 'Field Tags', and 'Cubby' are highlighted using case based
      scenarios.

TI  - Evaluation of French and English MeSH indexing systems with a parallel corpus.
PG  - 565-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the evaluation of two MeSH indexing systems for
      French and English on a parallel corpus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe two
      automatic MeSH in-dexing systems - MTI for English, and MAIF for French. The
      French version of the evaluation resources has been manually indexed with MeSH
      keyword/qualifier pairs. This professional indexing is used as our gold standard 
      in the evaluation of both systems on keyword retrieval. RESULTS: The English
      system (MTI) obtains significantly better precision and recall (78% precision and
      21% recall at rank 1, vs. 37%. precision and 6% recall for MAIF ). Moreover, the 
      performance of both systems can be optimised by the break-age function used by
      the French system (MAIF), which selects an adaptive number of descriptors for
      each resource indexed. CONCLUSION: MTI achieves better performance. However, both
      systems have features that can benefit each other.

TI  - Semi-automatic construction of the Chinese-English MeSH using Web-based term

PG  - 475-9
AB  - Due to language barrier, non-English users are unable to retrieve the most
      updated medical information from the U.S. authoritative medical websites, such as
      PubMed and MedlinePlus. A few cross-language medical information retrieval
      (CLMIR) systems have been utilizing MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) with
      multilingual thesaurus to bridge the gap. Unfortunately, MeSH has yet not been
      translated into traditional Chinese currently. We proposed a semi-automatic
      approach to constructing Chinese-English MeSH based on Web-based term
      translation. The system provides knowledge engineers with candidate terms mining 
      from anchor texts and search-result pages. The result is encouraging. Currently, 
      more than 19,000 Chinese-English MeSH entries have been complied. This thesaurus 
      will be used in Chinese-English CLMIR in the future.

TI  - A strategy for assigning new concepts in the MEDLINE database.
PG  - 395-9
AB  - The MeSH indexing done in MEDLINE is engineered by humans. Humans define the MeSH
      concepts and human indexers assign MeSH terms to MEDLINE records. Methods have
      been designed in an attempt to assign MeSH terms to MEDLINE documents
      automatically with some success. Methods have also been designed to locate useful
      phrases as potential concepts for indexing. However, little work has been done on
      the problem of how one might automatically index with the concepts represented by
      such phrases. Here we examine this issue and present a method for such indexing.

TI  - Semi-automatic indexing of full text biomedical articles.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - The main application of U.S. National Library of Medicine's Medical Text Indexer 
      (MTI) is to provide indexing recommendations to the Library's indexing staff. The
      current input to MTI consists of the titles and abstracts of articles to be
      indexed. This study reports on an extension of MTI to the full text of articles
      appearing in online medical journals that are indexed for Medline. Using a
      collection of 17 journal issues containing 500 articles, we report on the
      effectiveness of the contribution of terms by the whole article and also by each 
      section. We obtain the best results using a model consisting of the sections
      Results, Results and Discussion, and Conclusions together with the article's
      title and abstract, the captions of tables and figures, and sections that have no
      titles. The resulting model provides indexing significantly better (7.4%) than
      what is currently achieved using only titles and abstracts.

TI  - Searching the literature using medical subject headings versus text word with
      PubMed.
PG  - 336-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This study was conducted to investigate the performance of 
      two search strategies in the retrieval of information from the National Library
      of Medicine (NLM) on otolaryngology-head and neck surgery related conditions and 
      diagnoses using PubMed. METHODS: Two search strategies-one based on the use of
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the second based on text word searching-were 
      compared. RESULTS: The MeSH search provided a more efficient search than the text
      word search. CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck surgeons can most efficiently search the 
      NLM using PubMed as a search engine by initiating the search with MeSH terms.
      Once a key article is identified, the searcher should use the "Related Articles" 
      feature.

TI  - A MEDLINE categorization algorithm.
PG  - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Categorization is designed to enhance resource description by
      organizing content description so as to enable the reader to grasp quickly and
      easily what are the main topics discussed in it. The objective of this work is to
      propose a categorization algorithm to classify a set of scientific articles
      indexed with the MeSH thesaurus, and in particular those of the MEDLINE
      bibliographic database. In a large bibliographic database such as MEDLINE,
      finding materials of particular interest to a specialty group, or relevant to a
      particular audience, can be difficult. The categorization refines the retrieval
      of indexed material. In the CISMeF terminology, metaterms can be considered as
      super-concepts. They were primarily conceived to improve recall in the CISMeF
      quality-controlled health gateway. METHODS: The MEDLINE categorization algorithm 
      (MCA) is based on semantic links existing between MeSH terms and metaterms on the
      one hand and between MeSH subheadings and metaterms on the other hand. These
      links are used to automatically infer a list of metaterms from any MeSH
      term/subheading indexing. Medical librarians manually select the semantic links. 
      RESULTS: The MEDLINE categorization algorithm lists the medical specialties
      relevant to a MEDLINE file by decreasing order of their importance. The MEDLINE
      categorization algorithm is available on a Web site. It can run on any MEDLINE
      file in a batch mode. As an example, the top 3 medical specialties for the set of
      60 articles published in BioMed Central Medical Informatics & Decision Making,
      which are currently indexed in MEDLINE are: information science, organization and
      administration and medical informatics. CONCLUSION: We have presented a MEDLINE
      categorization algorithm in order to classify the medical specialties addressed
      in any MEDLINE file in the form of a ranked list of relevant specialties. The
      categorization method introduced in this paper is based on the manual indexing of
      resources with MeSH (terms/subheadings) pairs by NLM indexers. This algorithm may
      be used as a new bibliometric tool.

      terms. The frequency of the appearance of each keyword was sorted by a descending
      order. RESULTS: Coincidence rate of 1,235 keywords with MeSH terms was 51.6%. Out
      of them, depression, elderly, stress, self efficacy, quality of life, exercise,
      middle-aged women, and women appeared most frequently in descending order.
      CONCLUSION: Coincidence rate of the keywords with MeSH terms was at an acceptable
      level, however to improve it, the education of submitters and editorial board
      members are required, as well as the copy editor, to take a role in checking
      keywords. To infer the subjects of the research from keywords might well
      represent the recent topics of research work.

TI  - Searching PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies: the case of chromosome
      aberrations.
PG  - 227-9
AB  - The available tools for searching literature in the field of Molecular
      Epidemiology are largely unsatisfactory. To identify major problems in retrieving
      information on this discipline, we comment here on the results of a literature
      search on cytogenetic biomarkers in children exposed to environmental pollutants.
      The search, done on the PubMed/MedLine database, was based on a strategy
      combining descriptors listed in the PubMed Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
      Thesaurus and other available tools (free text or phrase search tools). 178
      articles were retrieved by searching the period from January 1, 1980 to November 
      30, 2004. Only 2 of the 178 articles were indexed by the MeSH term "Epidemiology,
      molecular" (introduced in 1994) and 30 of 178 by the MeSH term "Biological
      markers" (introduced in 1989). The case of chromosome aberration (CA) was
      emblematic of the problem: 44 of 78 articles (56.4%) were not pertinent to the
      search. The reasons for this poor performance are reported and discussed. Authors
      and indexers may be able to improve the efficiency of article retrieval in the
      field of molecular epidemiology by using relevant terms in the title and
      abstract. This may suggest appropriate MeSH terms to the indexers for the
      indexing process. As regards the difficulty in identifying population studies
      using CA, the introduction of a specific MeSH term for chromosome aberrations
      when used as a biomarker would improve the search process.

TI  - Searching the MEDLINE literature database through PubMed: a short guide.
PG  - 517-22
AB  - The Medline database from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) contains more
      than 12 million bibliographic citations from over 4,600 international biomedical 
      journals. One of the interfaces for searching Medline is PubMed, provided by the 
      NLM for free access via the Internet (www.pubmed.gov). Also searchable with the
      PubMed interface are non-Medline citations, i.e. articles supplied by publishers 
      to the NLM. Direct access to an electronic full text version is also possible if 
      the article is available from a publisher or institution participating in Linkout
      (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/). Some publishers provide free access to
      their journals. Other journals require an online license and are fee based. The
      following example demonstrates some of the most important search functions in
      PubMed. We will start out with a fast and simple approach without the use of
      specific searching techniques and then continue with a more sophisticated search 
      that requires the knowledge of Medline search functions. This example will show
      how the application of Medline search tools and how the use of the controlled
      vocabulary of 'Medical Subject Headings' (MeSH) will influence the results in
      comparison with the fast and simple approach. Let's try to find the best evidence
      to answer the following question: Is a 30-year-old man with typical acid reflux
      symptoms for many years (gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD) more likely to
      develop esophageal cancer than people without reflux symptoms? This question can 
      be split into several components: -a patient with reflux symptoms (GERD),
      -esophageal cancer: etiology, risk, -study design for etiology studies: cohort
      studies, case-control studies.

TI  - Grepator: accents & case mix for thesaurus.
PG  - 787-92
AB  - There is a real need among researchers and students for pedagogical resources. In
      France, information retrieval techniques have been developed, for example in the 
      Doc'CISMeF web site. As Pubmed, documents are indexed with (French) MeSH terms,
      one of the problems discovered, in quality studies, is the inadequacies between
      the user requests and the MeSH controlled vocabulary. Moreover, French (but also 
      Greek or Spanish), pose specific problems for indexing, due to the diacritic
      characters.In this article, we present the Grepator project. The main goal is to 
      transform any thesaurus (or any entry) in case mix and accentuated characters,
      for a specific domain. Furthermore, Grepator has to complete MeSH terms according
      to their usual form in natural language and finally, to correct user spelling
      mistakes. Grepator is based on a statistical approach. A large French medical
      corpus has been constituted from pedagogical resources indexed in CISMeF. Using
      regular expressions, Grepator searches the more usual ways to spell the word..
      Seventy five percent of MeSH terms are found in the corpus, using this method,
      with less than one mistake for a hundred words. This first evaluation of the
      tools is analyzed and we discuss further steps that might be developed.

TI  - Developing optimal search strategies for finding information on herbs and other
      medicinal plants in MEDLINE.
PG  - 725-31
AB  - The MEDLINE database is an important resource for locating up-to-date information
      on herbs and other botanical therapies. However, the evolving nature of
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and the complexity of herbal
      terminology can make it difficult to identify useful citations. This paper
      describes optimal search strategies for finding clinical information on herbs and
      medicinal plants in MEDLINE using the PubMed retrieval system. Searchers will
      benefit from an understanding of the structure of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
      and PubMed's advanced search capabilities. Details for using PubMed's MeSH
      Database, Clinical Queries, Clipboard, and limiting features to retrieve
      pertinent botanical research are described. Tables containing MeSH terms for
      medicinal plants and useful print and electronic resources are included.

TI  - MeSHer: identifying biological concepts in microarray assays based on PubMed
      references and MeSH terms.
PG  - 3324-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: MeSHer uses a simple statistical approach to identify biological
      concepts in the form of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) obtained from the
      PubMed database that are significantly overrepresented within the identified gene
      set relative to those associated with the overall collection of genes on the
      underlying DNA microarray platform. As a demonstration, we apply this approach to
      gene lists acquired from a published study of the effects of angiotensin II (Ang 
      II) treatment on cardiac gene expression and demonstrate that this approach can
      aid in the interpretation of the resulting 'significant' gene set. AVAILABILITY: 
      The software is available at http://www.tm4.org. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
      Results from the analysis of significant genes from the published Ang II study.

TI  - Optimal search strategies for retrieving scientifically strong studies of
      treatment from Medline: analytical survey.
PG  - 1179
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and test optimal Medline search strategies for retrieving
      sound clinical studies on prevention or treatment of health disorders. DESIGN:
      Analytical survey. DATA SOURCES: 161 clinical journals indexed in Medline for the
      year 2000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, precision, and
      accuracy of 4862 unique terms in 18 404 combinations. RESULTS: Only 1587 (24.2%) 
      of 6568 articles on treatment met criteria for testing clinical interventions.
      Combinations of search terms reached peak sensitivities of 99.3% (95% confidence 
      interval 98.7% to 99.8%) at a specificity of 70.4% (69.8% to 70.9%). Compared
      with best single terms, best multiple terms increased sensitivity for sound
      studies by 4.1% (absolute increase), but with substantial loss of specificity
      (absolute difference 23.7%) when sensitivity was maximised. When terms were
      combined to maximise specificity, 97.4% (97.3% to 97.6%) was achieved, about the 
      same as that achieved by the best single term (97.6%, 97.4% to 97.7%). The
      strategies newly reported in this paper outperformed other validated search
      strategies except for two strategies that had slightly higher specificity (98.1% 
      and 97.6% v 97.4%) but lower sensitivity (42.0% and 92.8% v 93.1%). CONCLUSION:
      New empirical search strategies have been validated to optimise retrieval from
      Medline of articles reporting high quality clinical studies on prevention or
      treatment of health disorders.

TI  - An implementation of the trigram phrase matching method for text similarity
      problems.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - The representation of texts by term vectors with element values calculated by a
      TFIDF method yields to significant results in text similarity problems, such as
      finding related documents in bibliographic or full-text databases and identifying
      MeSH concepts from medical texts by lexical approach and also harmonizing journal
      citation in ISI/SciELO references and normalizing author's affiliation in
      MEDLINE. Our work considered "trigrams" as the terms (elements) of a term vector 
      representing a text, according to the Trigram Phrase Matching published by the
      NLM's Indexing Initiative and its logarithmic Term Frequency-Inverse Document
      Frequency method for term weighting. Trigrams are overlapping 3-char strings from
      a text, extracted by a couple of rules, and a trigram matching method may improve
      the probability of identifying synonym phrases or similar texts. The matching
      process was implemented as a simple algorithm, and requires a certain amount of
      computer resources. An efficiency-focused C-programming was adopted. In addition,
      some heuristic rules improved the efficiency of the method and made it feasible a
      regular "find your scientific production in SciELO collection" information
      service. We describe an implementation of the Trigram Matching method, the
      software tool we developed and a set of experimental parameters for the above
      results.

TI  - [Key words, essential tools for bibliographic research: analysis of usage in
      Archivos de Bronconeumologia for respiratory system knowledge areas].
PG  - 78-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze key word usage in Archivos de Bronconeumologia, by
      comparing words used in the journal to those used in the Index Medicus database
      within various respiratory system knowledge areas, and to determine whether usage
      has changed over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Original articles published in
      Archivos de Bronconeumologia from 1994 through 2001 were reviewed manually to
      gather the key words used. The list was translated to English and then compared
      to the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms used in the PubMed Browser. RESULTS: 
      Seven hundred six original articles published in the study period used a total of
      1163 key words. Matches with MeSH terms were found for 62% (n=46) of the key
      words in smoking research, 48% (n=52) in asthma, 39% (n=82) in respiratory
      insufficiency and sleep disorders, 60% (n=49) in diagnostic and treatment
      techniques, 61% (n=35) in tuberculosis, 65% (n=87) in nontuberculous infections, 
      61% (n=121) in oncology, 60% (n=37) in circulation, 55% (n=47) in pleural
      diseases, 48% (n=21) in pathophysiology, and 64% (n=68) in interstitial diseases.
      We did not see a clear tendency in the evolution of the journal's key word usage 
      for the knowledge areas analyzed during the study period. The percentage of
      matching key words held steady around 50% over the last 3 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Respiratory system key words in the knowledge areas we investigated are used
      correctly in Archivos de Bronconeumologia only about 50% of the time.

TI  - Enhancing the MeSH thesaurus to retrieve French online health resources in a
      quality-controlled gateway.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - The amount of health information available on the Internet is considerable. In
      this context, several health gateways have been developed. Among them, CISMeF
      (Catalogue and Index of Health Resources in French) was designed to catalogue and
      index health resources in French. The goal of this article is to describe the
      various enhancements to the MeSH thesaurus developed by the CISMeF team to adapt 
      this terminology to the broader field of health Internet resources instead of
      scientific articles for the medline bibliographic database. CISMeF uses two
      standard tools for organizing information: the MeSH thesaurus and several
      metadata element sets, in particular the Dublin Core metadata format. The
      heterogeneity of Internet health resources led the CISMeF team to enhance the
      MeSH thesaurus with the introduction of two new concepts, respectively, resource 
      types and metaterms. CISMeF resource types are a generalization of the
      publication types of medline. A resource type describes the nature of the
      resource and MeSH keyword/qualifier pairs describe the subject of the resource. A
      metaterm is generally a medical specialty or a biological science, which has
      semantic links with one or more MeSH keywords, qualifiers and resource types. The
      CISMeF terminology is exploited for several tasks: resource indexing performed
      manually, resource categorization performed automatically, visualization and
      navigation through the concept hierarchies and information retrieval using the
      Doc'CISMeF search engine. The CISMeF health gateway uses several MeSH thesaurus
      enhancements to optimize information retrieval, hierarchy navigation and
      automatic indexing.

TI  - Distilling conceptual connections from MeSH co-occurrences.
PG  - 808-12
AB  - Our aim is to contribute to biomedical text extraction and mining research. In
      this paper we present exploratory research on the MeSH terms assigned to MEDLINE 
      citations. We analyze MeSH based co-occurrences and identify the interesting
      ones, i.e., those that are likely to be semantically meaningful. For each
      selected co-occurring pair we derive a weighted vector representation that
      emphasizes the verb based functional aspects of the underlying semantics.
      Preliminary experiments exploring the potential value of these vectors gave us
      very good results. The larger goal of this project is to contribute to knowledge 
      discovery research by mining the knowledge that is latent within the biomedical
      literature. It is also to provide a method capable of suggesting
      cross-disciplinary connections via the pairs derived from all of MEDLINE.

TI  - MeSH and specialized terminologies: coverage in the field of molecular biology.
PG  - 530-4
AB  - There is real need among researchers for data in molecular biology, due to the
      explosive development in this field. Information extraction techniques have been 
      developed in this specific domain, to extract structured information from the
      literature. The National Library of Medicine provides access to 12 million
      MEDLINE citations, accessible via PubMed. Information retrieval techniques which 
      are used to select documents that are relevant according to user request. As
      other domains in medicine, biomolecular scientific literature is indexed by MeSH 
      terms. Automatic identification of protein and gene names in scientific articles 
      is an important step in the indexing process, since proteins and genes are often 
      associated with multiple names, and authors alternate between these synonyms. In 
      this article we assess the contribution of specialized terminologies in the field
      of molecular biology compared to MeSH.

TI  - WRAPIN: new generation health search engine using UMLS knowledge sources for MeSH
      term extraction from health documentation.
PG  - 356-60
AB  - To realize the potential of the Internet as a source of valuable healthcare
      information, for the general public, patients or practitioners, it is imperative 
      to establish a validation system based on standards of quality. The WRAPIN
      project (World-wide online Reliable Advice to Patients and Individuals) from the 
      European Community has this ambitious goal. WRAPIN is a federating system for
      medical information with an editorial policy of intelligently sharing quality and
      professional information. The WRAPIN project has two main axes: the efficient and
      intelligent search of information and the assertion of the trustworthiness of
      content. This article presents the scientific challenges involved in extracting
      the knowledge from text-based information in order to better manage the knowledge
      and the rest of the retrieval proc-ess. Our innovative approach is to efficiently
      extract MeSH terms from the analyzed documents exploiting UMLS knowledge sources.
      A benefit has been measured when comparing extraction results. Even if the
      evaluation is made with a limited corpus, this research work proposes heuristics 
      that can be validated to the whole biomedical domain, and possibly enhanced by
      the adjunction of other methods.

TI  - Application of a Medical Text Indexer to an online dermatology atlas.
PG  - 287-91
AB  - Clinical dermatology cases are presented as images and semi-structured text
      describing skin lesions and their relationships to disease. Metadata assignment
      to such cases is hampered by lack of a standardized dermatology vocabulary and
      facilitated methods for indexing legacy collections. In this pilot study
      descriptive clinical text from Dermatlas, a Web-based repository of dermatology
      cases, was indexed to Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms using the National
      Library of Medicine's Medical Text Indexer (MTI). The MTI is an automated text
      processing system that derives ranked lists of MeSH terms to describe the content
      of medical journal citations using knowledge from the Unified Medical Language
      System (UMLS) and from MEDLINE. For a representative, random sample of 50
      Dermatlas cases, the MTI frequently derived MeSH indexing terms that matched
      expert-assigned terms for Diagnoses (88%), Lesion Types (72%), and Patient
      Characteristics (Gender and Age Groups, 62% and 84% respectively). This pilot
      demonstrates the potential for extending the MTI to automate indexing of clinical
      case presentations and for using MeSH to describe aspects of clinical
      dermatology.

      been used in both semi-automated and fully automated indexing environments at the
      Library since mid 2002. We report here on an experiment conducted with MEDLINE
      indexers to evaluate MTI's performance and to generate ideas for its improvement 
      as a tool for user-assisted indexing. We also discuss some filtering techniques
      developed to improve MTI's accuracy for use primarily in automatically producing 
      the indexing for several abstracts collections.

TI  - The MeSH translation maintenance system: structure, interface design, and
      implementation.
PG  - 67-9
AB  - The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces annual editions of the Medical
      Subject Headings (MeSH). Translations of MeSH are often done to make the
      vocabulary useful for non-English users. However, MeSH translators have
      encountered difficulties with entry vocabulary as they maintain and update their 
      translation. Tracking MeSH changes and updating their translations in a
      reasonable time frame is cumbersome. NLM has developed and implemented a
      concept-centered vocabulary maintenance system for MeSH. This system has been
      extended to create an interlingual database of translations, the MeSH Translation
      Maintenance System (MTMS). This database allows continual updating of the
      translations, as well as facilitating tracking of the changes within MeSH from
      one year to another. The MTMS interface uses a Web-based design with multiple
      colors and fonts to indicate concepts needing translation or review. Concepts for
      which there is no exact English equivalent can be added. The system software
      encourages compliance with the Unicode standard in order to ensure that character
      sets with native alphabets and full orthography are used consistently.

TI  - The gene ontology categorizer.
PG  - i169-77
AB  - The Gene Ontology Categorizer, developed jointly by the Los Alamos National
      Laboratory and Procter & Gamble Corp., provides a capability for the
      categorization task in the Gene Ontology (GO): given a list of genes of interest,
      what are the best nodes of the GO to summarize or categorize that list? The
      motivating question is from a drug discovery process, where after some gene
      expression analysis experiment, we wish to understand the overall effect of some 
      cell treatment or condition by identifying 'where' in the GO the differentially
      expressed genes fall: 'clustered' together in one place? in two places? uniformly
      spread throughout the GO? 'high', or 'low'? In order to address this need, we
      view bio-ontologies more as combinatorially structured databases than facilities 
      for logical inference, and draw on the discrete mathematics of finite partially
      ordered sets (posets) to develop data representation and algorithms appropriate
      for the GO. In doing so, we have laid the foundations for a general set of
      methods to address not just the categorization task, but also other tasks (e.g.
      distances in ontologies and ontology merger and exchange) in both the GO and
      other bio-ontologies (such as the Enzyme Commission database or the MEdical
      Subject Headings) cast as hierarchically structured taxonomic knowledge systems.

TI  - Visual mapping for medical concepts.
PG  - 912
AB  - Concept relationships are traditionally defined in human-generated vocabulary
      lists such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). This poster describes a
      prototype system that automatically generates concept relationships from the
      medical literature. The system is directly connected to the PUBMED search engine.
      For any given medical concept, the system will generate two styles of visual maps
      from MEDLINE in real time. Users can use the maps to explore concept
      relationships or construct better search queries interactively.

TI  - Automated knowledge extraction for decision model construction: a data mining
      approach.
PG  - 758-62
AB  - Combinations of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Subheadings in MEDLINE
      citations may be used to infer relationships among medical concepts. To
      facilitate clinical decision model construction, we propose an approach to
      automatically extract semantic relations among medical terms from MEDLINE
      citations. We use the Apriori association rule mining algorithm to generate the
      co-occurrences of medical concepts, which are then filtered through a set of
      predefined semantic templates to instantiate useful relations. From such semantic
      relations, decision elements and possible relationships among them may be derived
      for clinical decision model construction. To evaluate the proposed method, we
      have conducted a case study in colorectal cancer management; preliminary results 
      have shown that useful causal relations and decision alternatives can be
      extracted.

TI  - The dimensions of indexing.
PG  - 714-0
AB  - Indexing of documents is an important strategy intended to make the literature
      more readily available to the user. Here we describe several dimensions of
      indexing that are important if indexing is to be optimal. These dimensions are
      coverage, predictability, and transparency. MeSH terms and text words are
      compared in MEDLINE in regard to these dimensions. Part of our analysis consists 
      in applying AdaBoost with decisions trees as the weak learners to estimate how
      reliably index terms are being assigned and how complex the criteria are by which
      they are being assigned. Our conclusions are that MeSH terms are more predictable
      and more transparent than text words.

TI  - Gene indexing: characterization and analysis of NLM's GeneRIFs.
PG  - 460-4
AB  - We present an initial analysis of the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Gene
      Indexing initiative. Gene Indexing occurs at the time of indexing for all 4600
      journals and over 500,000 articles added to PubMed/MEDLINE each year. Gene
      Indexing links articles about the basic biology of a gene or protein within eight
      model organisms to a specific record in the NLM's LocusLink database of gene
      products. The result is an entry called a Gene Reference Into Function (GeneRIF) 
      within the LocusLink database. We analyzed the numbers of GeneRIFs produced in
      the first year of GeneRIF production. 27,645 GeneRIFs were produced, pertaining
      to 9126 loci over eight model organisms. 60% of these were associated with human 
      genes and 27% with mouse genes. About 80% discuss genes with an established MeSH 
      Heading or other MeSH term. We developed a prototype functional alerting system
      for researchers based on the GeneRIFs, and a strategy to find all of the
      literature related to genes. We conclude that the Gene Indexing initiative adds
      considerable value to the life sciences research community.

TI  - SUBJECT HEADINGS IN THE WELLCOME HISTORICAL MEDICAL LIBRARY.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - The strength and unity of the medical library profession spring largely from the 
      existence of the National Library of Medicine. Its publications promise to bring 
      much closer the standardization and consistency still lacking to the world of
      medical subject headings. The Wellcome Library headings are similar to those
      listed in the National Library of Medicine Subject Heading Authority List of
      1960. However, references and additional headings are made to cover (1)
      superseded terms, (2) historical phenomena with distinctive names which are
      peculiar to an epoch, (3) subjects from social, religious, or other branches of
      history, and (4) eponyms. Old texts often describe disease ambiguously or use
      terminology which has since been superseded. The catalogue is in three
      parts-topographical, biographical, and topical. The quarterly Current Work has
      certain simplifications (e.g., elimination of some subheadings), and has recently
      introduced references both to cut down needless duplication and to facilitate
      consultation by the reader.

TI  - MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS IN MEDLARS.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - Use of an identical subject heading list for both machine searching and
      publication creates problems. Necessary compromises include precoordination of
      some headings for publication and use of some coordinates in the computer system 
      that are not appropriate for a printed index. Determination of the headings under
      which a citation will appear in Index Medicus and those which will be used for it
      only in the computer requires anticipation of the way the published index will be
      used for search. Methods of selecting new terms are discussed and opinions
      solicited. The computer will be used in several ways to update the system and
      provide for annual publication of the subject heading list.
